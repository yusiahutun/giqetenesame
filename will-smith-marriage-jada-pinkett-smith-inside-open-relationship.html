"It’s hard...The thing Will and I talk about a lot is the journey. We started in this [relationship] at a very young age, 22 years old ... I think you expect your partner to know - especially when it comes to sex. It’s like: 'Well, if you love me, you should know. If you love me, you should read my mind.' That’s a huge pitfall," she said.</p><p id=eYsNkR_pchGC data-wc=79>The Matrix star continued by discussing the importance of communicating your desires with your partner, something she does with her husband. She said: "You tell me what you need. Tell me what you want, and on top of it, I know that I have to be accountable to do the same...I really try. It's uncomfortable, but it's deeply healthy, and I think around sex because it's something that we don't talk about and there's so much fantasy around it."</p><h2>When did they have children?</h2><p id=eW3Ynl8jdRI6 data-wc=43>The pair share two children, <a class=hm-link href=#>Jaden, 25</a>, and <a class=hm-link href=#>Willow, 22</a>.
