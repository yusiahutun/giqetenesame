I was on my own… and Rick walked in. I'd never met him before, but I have no idea why I did this, but I just went like this. A peace sign."</p><p id=eZhGo8V_Rsb data-wc=29>Her funny gesture worked, as she continued: "He just sort of walked across the room towards me and sat down next to me. He said, 'Hello, who are you?'"</p><p id=ea4DcQCx_Y1 data-wc=58>After the show ended, they were left at the bus stop together, and Emer joked that Rick was "playing it cool" as he was busy reading his emails. Rick quipped: "I'm a busy guy, a lot of important stuff to get through. Listen, I know how to charm a lady.
