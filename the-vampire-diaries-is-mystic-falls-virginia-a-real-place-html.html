The show ran for eight seasons and won four People’s Choice Awards and numerous Teen Choice Awards. Receiving many award nominations and having a well-crafted storyline quickly made&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries one of the most-watched series on the network. Developed by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec, the supernatural TV show is based on a book series with the same title.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_114>The teen drama was set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia, which had a rich supernatural history with generations of witches, werewolves, and vampires that shape the residents’ current lives. The show follows the life of Elena Gilbert, played by Nina Dobrev, who recently lost both of her parents in a car accident. Shortly after the tragic accident, Elena falls in love with vampire Stefan Salvatore, played by <a href=#>Paul Wesley</a>. Stefan’s vampire brother, Damon Salvatore, played by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ian Somerhalder</a>, returns to create a love triangle among the three.
