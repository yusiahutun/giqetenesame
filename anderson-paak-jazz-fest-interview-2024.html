It’s a place where acts like local hip-hop legend Juvenile, country superstar Chris Stapleton, and even the Rolling Stones can all share space.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Maurice, our trumpet player, has been talking about Jazz Fest for years. We've tried to come out here a couple of times, whether it’s to do a full set or a jam session,” .Paak tells Harper’s Bazaar in an exclusive interview a few days before the band’s headlining set on Sunday, April 28, closing out the festival’s first of two weekends in 2024. “Sometimes we’ve thought, ‘Damn, I wish we knew about this when we were broke playing in L.A. and no one gave a shit.’ You don’t have to have a penny to your name here, and people will still come out and support—it’s amazing. It’s why I love this city so much.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like many who venture to the Crescent City for Jazz Fest (around half a million tourists come over the dual weekends year after year), .Paak feels a certain magic when he’s in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/travel-dining/a60569096/new-orleans-travel-guide/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New Orleans" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">New Orleans</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You can feel it as soon as soon as you touch down here—there’s something different,” he says. “And as for the fest, it’s one of the best lineups I’ve been a part of—period. To be able to be in the midst of all these legendary acts and up-and-coming acts and local acts, it means a lot to us. We really put a lot into this set to make it special for the fans and for everyone out here.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“You don’t have to have a penny to your name here, and people will still come out and support. It’s why I love this city so much.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A global perspective is also what .Paak had in mind when teaming up with Expedia (the festival’s official travel sponsor) to curate its first Global Jam event on Friday, to kick off the weekend. At the revered Joy Theater, the artist was joined onstage by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/tankandthebangas/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tank and the Bangas" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Tank and the Bangas</a> and Colombian group <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/bombaestereo/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bomba Estéreo" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Bomba Estéreo</a> for a celebration of the sounds that shape not only New Orleans, but also the rest of the world. Anderson .Paak’s musical alter ego, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/djpee.wee/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DJ Pee Wee" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">DJ Pee Wee</a>, made an appearance too that evening, blessing the crowd with a late-night, ’70s-centric vinyl set—and yes, his famous silk press was present and on point.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’ve never done anything like [Global Jam]—at least not to this extent—and Expedia was great when it came to just letting me put together a jam session with people that I like and have wanted to collaborate with,” he says just before the event. “We have <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/raekhalil/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rhae Khalil" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rhae Khalil</a>, who is an artist I’ve signed also from L.A., and it will be her first time playing here. We have Bomba Estéreo, who are so dope, and I love being able to bring their flavor here. And [Free Nationals and I] haven’t done a show since last December, and so we’re just excited to be performing again.”</p><img alt="anderson paak jazz fest new orleans 2024 expedia global jam" title="anderson paak jazz fest new orleans 2024 expedia global jam" width=5564 height=3710 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/eg300976-iykxr6qf-66301b59c60be.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Erika Goldring</span><p>DJ Pee Wee—a.k.a. Anderson .Paak—at the 2024 Expedia Global Jam</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The event, which turned out to feature surprise guests like Grammy and Oscar winner—and the current reigning king of New Orleans—<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a39435219/in-conversation-jon-batiste-alicia-graf-mack-april-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jon Batiste" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Jon Batiste</a>, felt more like a family reunion for .Paak and the band than just another gig. It was a necessary reminder that they do all this for a reason.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It all feels like what we used to do—you know, just jamming,” he says. “Sometimes [with success] you get so far removed from that, and it becomes about something else. It’s good to have these things that bring you back to the foundation of why you started and [why] you fall in love with what you do.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
