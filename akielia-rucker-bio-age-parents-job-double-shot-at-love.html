The only remaining contestants that were still in the race to be Vinny‚Äôs pick are <a href=#>Emily ‚ÄúPeachy‚Äù Piccinonno</a>, Danielle Hopson, Erika DeVito, Kristen Panarella, and Akielia Rucker.</p><p>In this article, we will be talking about how good a chance does Akielia has of being Vinny‚Äôs pick at the season finale of Double Shot At Love. We will also talk about Akielia‚Äôs job, parents, Instagram, and more.</p><h3><strong>Akielia Rucker On Double Shot At Love</strong></h3><p>Double Shot at Love, an American reality TV show, started as a means to find a match for Jersey Shore stars DJ Pauly D and Vinny Guadagnino. Pauly found his long-lasting love with Nikki Hall in the 1st season of Double Shot at Love. Now it‚Äôs the job of Pauly and Nikki to guide Vinny in his search for the perfect match.</p><p>Before analyzing Akielia‚Äôs shot at making Vinny her man, we have to look at Akielia‚Äôs Instagram. What we learn from Akielia‚Äôs Instagram is that the two do seem to have a genuine connection. One of Akielia‚Äôs Instagram posts was a video of her playing basketball against Vinny. She wrote, ‚ÄúHaha YESSIRSKIII!! üòà Fun fact: I‚Äôm a retired college hooper! üèÄüòå Catch me and Vin in MY element tonight on an all-new episode of @doubleshotatlove ‚ÄºÔ∏èüíï Who do you have your money on!?,‚Äù in the caption.</p><p>That being said, Vinny‚Äôs track record on finding his love on Double Shot at Love is not too good. Vinny picked Alysse Joyner from Brooklyn, New York as the winner of Season 1 but their relationship did not last long. In the 2nd season too, Vinny developed connections with several women but still did not find a match for himself by the end of the show.</p><p>However, this time could be different as Pauly D and Nikki have joined hands to help Vinny find his perfect match.</p><p>As of 20th November 2021, we are not sure if Vinny will pick Akielia in the season finale.

To say this season is going to be a movie is an understatement‚ÄºÔ∏è‚Äù</p><p>Akielia‚Äôs LinkedIn profile also reveals that she is a licensed Practical Nurse at Favorite Healthcare Staffing.</p><p>Though we don‚Äôt know how much she earned for being the cast member of Double Shot at Love and Wild ‚Äòn Out, she earns around $46 thousand on an average in a year as a nurse.</p><p>Her net worth was estimated to be under 300 thousand as of this writing.</p><h3><strong>Is Akielia Rucker On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Akielia Rucker is on Instagram as @realakieliabreonia.
