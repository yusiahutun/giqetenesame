To thank the person who brought them into this world and raised them, people throughout history and across the globe have celebrated Mother’s Day in different forms.</span></p><p type=p><span type=text>But not every country observes it on the same day, and different celebrations around the world have their own stories and origins. Read on to learn more about how the time to honour mothers and women traces back to the era of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks.</span></p><p><h3 type=h3><strong type=strong><span type=text>When is Mother’s Day?</span></strong></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The answer to this question depends on where you are from. Like many places such as the US and Australia, Hong Kong celebrates Mother’s Day on the second Sunday of every May – which this year falls on May 8.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>In other countries, the day is related to religious celebrations. For example, in Britain and Ireland, Mother’s Day coincides with Mothering Sunday, a day to honour the church where someone is baptised. The celebration falls on the fourth Sunday of Lent, three weeks before Easter Sunday. This year, it took place on March 27.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>And in some Southeast Asian countries, Mother’s Day commemorates important historical figures and events. Thailand observes the celebration on August 12, the birthday of Queen Sirikit, who is regarded as the “Mother of Thailand”. Mother’s Day in Indonesia is on December 22 to honour the first Indonesian Women’s Congress which convened on that day in 1928 to fight for women’s rights.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">In Thailand, the day to celebrate mothers is on Queen Sirikit’s birthday on August 12.

Centuries later in ancient Greece, the mother of all gods, Rhea, was worshipped through a festival every spring, during which people would make offerings of honey cakes, flowers and expensive drinks.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>In the United Kingdom, Mothering Sunday goes back to the Middle Ages, when Christians would return to their “mother church” where they were baptised and became “children of God”. Over time, it became a day when children who worked far from home could return to visit their mothers – during this time, it was common for kids as young as 10 to leave home for work.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">In ancient Egypt, the goddess Isis was thought of as the mother of all pharaohs.

In 1908, Anna Jarvis started the tradition to honour how devoted mothers are to their children, as she was inspired by the life of her late mother who was an activist and social worker.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>In May of that year, the first Mother’s Day was held at a church, where Jarvis handed out carnations, her mother’s favourite flower. Its popularity grew as Jarvis organised campaigns to make the celebration an official day. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson declared the second Sunday in May to be Mother’s Day “as a public expression of love and reverence for the mothers of our country”.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=8743b4a4-a7f1-11eb-b289-8dea5309a3db data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>Our favourite screen mothers, from </span><span type=text>Stranger Things</span><span type=text>’ Joyce Byers to </span><span type=text>Harry Potter</span><span type=text>’s Molly Weasley</span></strong></a></p><p><h3 type=h3><strong type=strong><span type=text>What do people usually give to their mothers?</span></strong></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>While people usually buy flowers and gifts and organise family gatherings to celebrate the day, even a simple “I love you” or “Thank you” can be powerful.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Today, why not try conveying your love for your mother by saying it out loud?
