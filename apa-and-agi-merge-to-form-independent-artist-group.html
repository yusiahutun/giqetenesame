We have admired how Jim Osborne and their colleagues have been market leaders in creating brand expanding, non-touring revenue opportunities for their clients and we are excited to build on that success with them and look forward to integrating under the Independent Artist Group (IAG) banner,” added Dennis Arfa.</p><p>Dennis Arfa echoed Osborne’s sentiments, stating that the merger was the natural next step in their evolution and would benefit their valued artists.
