It makes sense <a href=#>Starrr’s makeup line would be called One/Size</a> then. The idea of one/size fits all clothing is pretty ridiculous when you think about how the average size model is a 2 and the average size woman is a 14. Makeup, on the other hand, is for everyone, regardless of size, sexuality, gender or skin color.&nbsp;“Listen, I’m a gay, plus-size, makeup-loving, fashion-loving, Filipino man,” Starrr says in one campaign video. “And I wouldn’t change a damn part about that sentence.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>The <a href=#>beauty mogul</a> revealed he’s been working on the vegan and <a href=#>cruelty-free</a> One/Size for two years and this is obviously a very personal project for him. “A beauty brand that stands up for every brand of beauty,” he continues in the video. “To me, One/Size is a safe space that belongs to anyone and everyone. It encourages you to be confident in your own skin, it persuades you to have a strong sense of self. It inspires you to live your best life.”</p><p>If you’re anything like us, when you heard that Starrr’s first drop was <a href=#>makeup remover</a>, you might have been a little confused. But for Starrr, the Go Off line is a nod to an experience he had when he was shamed for wearing his full glam at work. “Years ago I was asked to <a href=#>remove my makeup</a> at work because I wasn’t ‘on trend,'” he says. “This is my way of turning the tables and reclaiming that anecdote. No one else can define ourselves but us. It’s time to rewrite the narrative. It’s time to re-tell our story.”</p><p>Okay, now let’s get to the products that are officially out today!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patrick-starrr-go-off-wipes.png><h2>Go Off Juciest Makeup Remover Wipes</h2><p>These extra-large, “mess-free” wipes contain coconut water to cleanse and hydrate, Aloe Leaf extract to moisturize and chamomile and cucumber extracts to soothe and relieve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patrick-starrr-go-off-mist.png><h2>Go Off Makeup Dissolving Mist</h2><p>This continuous mist promises to dissolve even the heaviest makeup without leaving the skin tight and dry.
