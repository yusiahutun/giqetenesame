But what if you don't have the dock with you? Or worse – what if your Nintendo Switch dock breaks? Can you connect a Switch to your TV without the dock?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yes, you can.</p><p>This workaround lets you hook up your Nintendo Switch to a TV without the dock.</p><h2 id=why-connect-a-nintendo-switch-to-a-tv-without-the-dock>Why Connect a Nintendo Switch to a TV Without the Dock?</h2><p>If you have a nice, fully functional Nintendo Switch dock, it might seem pointless to worry about connecting the console to a TV. After all, this is one of the key purposes of the dock, alongside charging the Switch.</p><p>But what if the dock is broken? After all, it's a pretty lightweight piece of kit. It could easily end up snapping, getting crushed, or cracking following a fall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/muo-diy-nintendo-switch-without-dock-dock.jpg><p>There are other reasons, too. If you take your Nintendo Switch on holiday and find there is a big TV you can use for multiplayer action, you're stuck. You probably didn't pack the dock, after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not to mention, it's quite nice to have the Switch in full view instead of hidden in the dock. If you like to play Switch games with the console mounted on a stand, having the option of swapping to the big screen is good. It's also an option you don't usually have.</p><h2 id=how-a-nintendo-switch-normally-connects-to-tv>How a Nintendo Switch Normally Connects to TV</h2><p>The video and power cabling on a Nintendo Switch is routed into the back of the dock. You probably recall from setting the device up that the ports are covered with a hinged door. Behind here you'll find, in order, the USB-C power input, a USB 3.0 port for additional storage, and the HDMI output.</p><p>Power and data for all these connections are converted to USB-C which is then routed around the bottom of the dock. Here, a single USB-C port connects to the docked Nintendo Switch. This single port charges the battery and keeps the device powered when docked. It also routes video data to your TV via HDMI and manages data from a USB storage device.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-connect-nintendo-switch-to-a-tv-without-the-dock>How to Connect Nintendo Switch to a TV Without the Dock</h2><p>Clearly, you need a USB-C to HDMI adapter to play with your Nintendo Switch on a TV without the dock.</p><p>To try this out, I ordered a standard USB-C to HDMI adapter from Amazon. It has three inputs, just like the back of the Switch's dock, and a single USB-C output.</p><p>To connect your Nintendo Switch to your HDTV without using the dock:</p><li>Disconnect the USB-C and HDMI cables from the back of the dock<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/muo-diy-nintendo-switch-without-dock-open-dock.jpg></li><li>Mount the Switch on a stand or lay it flat on a table near the TV</li><li>Connect the USB-C power cable and HDMI cable to the USB-C to HDMI adapter<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/muo-diy-nintendo-switch-without-dock-adapter.jpg></li><li>Now connect that USB-C to HDMI adapter to the Nintendo Switch</li><li>Select the correct channel on your TV</li><li>Start playing games<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/muo-diy-nintendo-switch-without-dock-connected.jpg></li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can use the Joy-Cons individually, connected to the Joy-Con Grip, or use a Switch Pro Controller, just as you would normally. There should be absolutely no difference to the experience, other than the absence of the Nintendo Switch dock.</p><p>As you can see, this is a relatively straightforward process. However, it won't work with all USB-C to HDMI adapters. You need to make sure you have an adapter that is compatible with the Nintendo Switch.</p><h3 id=nintendo-switch-compatible-usb-c-to-hdmi-adapters>Nintendo Switch Compatible USB-C to HDMI Adapters</h3><p>Which Switch-compatible USB-C to HDMI adapters should you use?
