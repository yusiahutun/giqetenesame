Even though it was just a few in a lonesome cluster, and even though I could only really see them if I looked up close, I scoffed at them the same way someone might look at someone intruding on your personal space on the subway. I know it’s a first world problem—and even then, not a big one—but as someone who takes obsessive care of my skin, these few blackheads sent me into panic mode. I needed to obliterate them STAT.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/herbivore-botanicals-moon-dew-eye-cream-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/herbivore.jpg><p>Though I should know better, I went to town with a charcoal mask, then a physical exfoliant, and then a chemical one; when all three combined, it was perfect storm of irritation. I left my chin raw and in a few days, not only were the blackheads still there and practically laughing at me, but dry flaky skin was now surrounding them. Fun times!</p><p>As I searched through my skin-care arsenal for something—anything—that might calm my skin down, or hydrate it, or make the general grossness go away, I landed on dropper of <a href=# rel=nofollow>Herbivore’s Lapis Facial Oil</a>. Within hours, my skin was on the mend—less red and painful to the touch—and within two days, the flakiness that would usually take about a week to dissipate was almost undetectable. I attributed it to magic, but my derm told me it was probably the blue tansy in the face oil.</p><p>Never heard of it? Even though you’ve probably <a href=# rel=nofollow>double-tapped on it</a> at some point—the tourmaline-colored oil is <a href=# rel=nofollow>super-Instagrammable</a>—it’s not yet widely recognized. Known as Moroccan chamomile and might be listed as “tanacetum annuum” on a skin-care product’s ingredients list, blue tansy is an oil that’s “loaded with the antioxidant&nbsp;azulene, which calms inflammation, be it from dryness or environmental damage from UV light exposure, or pollution,” says <a href=# rel=nofollow>dermatologist Joshua Zeichner</a>, MD and Director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research at the Department of Dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, who says it’s great for all skin-types.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gigi-blue-tansy-perfect-skin.jpg><p>And he’s not alone: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Dermatologist Annie Chiu</a> agrees: “It balances oily skin,&nbsp;moisturizes dry skin, and will enhance normal skin’s natural glow.”</p><p>So that explains why blue tansy works wonders any time my skin’s in freak-out mode, like if I OD’d on the retinol, or mixed an irritating cocktail of products, or if the weather turns my skin flaky and dry. But how, exactly, does it stack up against other skin-soothing ingredients like aloe, shea butter, or coconut oil?</p><p>“Blue&nbsp;tansy is a lighter, more quickly absorbed oil&nbsp;than shea butter and coconut oil,” Dr. Chiu tells me. “It moisturizes well and might feel better on the skin to some, than shea butter, coconut oil, or aloe.&nbsp;Plus, shea butter isn’t considered non-comedogenic but because it’s very high in oleic acid, it could promote clogged pores. Coconut oil is moderately&nbsp;comedogenic, but blue tansy is not comedogenic at all—and its antibacterial properties help with acne.”</p><p>The latter explains my jawline has cleared up over the past few weeks, and possibly why my skin is insanely glow-y, if I do say so myself. And if it wasn’t enough of a wonder product, Zeicher tells me blue tansy is also a powerful anti-ager.
