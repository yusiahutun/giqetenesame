Crystal Gayle is Loretta Lynn's sister, the Loretta Lynn who gave the world an undying legacy with songs like "You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Things started to go right for Crystal thereon.&nbsp; Her sister helped her sign a recording contract with Decca Records.&nbsp;</p><p>Amassing a decent success, she shifted her genre to country-pop, and that was it. Since then, the world has got to hear more of Crystal's record-breaking hits. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Her song, "Wrong Road Again," soon became her first major success (1975), but this was just a start.
