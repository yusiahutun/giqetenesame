This is the case for <a href=#><span class=s2><a href=# id=auto-tag_vitamin-c data-tag=vitamin-c>vitamin C</a>-focused serums and creams</span></a>, which have been hot on the market, well, since they’ve arrived. But, not all of these products are created equally. Some have a sticky after-feel, some smell funky, and others are just plain bad. However, one fascinating newbie to the field has caught shoppers’ attention rather quickly.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>It’s <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><a href=# id=auto-tag_alpyn-beauty data-tag=alpyn-beauty>Alpyn Beauty</a>‘s Triple Vitamin C Bounce Cream</span></a>—and it is not your mother’s typical topical moisturizer.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Instead of relying on different chemicals or added agents to relieve skin of dryness, <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Alpyn Beauty’s cream relies on nature</span></a>. It’s entirely wildcrafted, which means all of the ingredients are picked in nature in a way that allows for the plants from which they come to continue growing. It’s a renewable and eco-friendly process that is almost entirely unique to this beauty brand. While it launched not even a month ago, it’s already sold out once <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>on the brand’s website</span></a>. But fear not: It’s still in stock at <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Sephora</span></a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>Credo Beauty</span></a>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Made entirely with ingredients found in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, this nourishing cream uses a whopping <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2>three forms of vitamin C</span></a> (with an added boost from chokecherries and aloe) to smooth out skin tone and texture. This blend of powerhouse ingredients forms one ultra-hydrating product that shoppers of all skin types love for bringing back bounciness and glow.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“It has really brought my skin to life,” wrote one five-star reviewer. “My skin feels so much more hydrated and thanks to the vitamin C, looks a lot brighter.”</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

According to the brand’s founder, Kendra Kolb Butler, the parched plants from which the ingredients are derived are crucial to providing the skin moisture that sticks around all day long.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Parched plants heal dry skin because they’ve figured out how to hold and retain moisture themselves over dry periods of time,” she told StyleCaster. “Thus, this product performs exceptionally well on dry and dehydrated skin.</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“The texture is like a cream gel,” she said. “Apply it at morning and at night.

That’s why so many reviewers say it’s an essential winter skincare routines.
