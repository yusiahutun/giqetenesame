The knee-jerk reaction from some internet users was to assume its owner – believed to be a woman from Nanjing in east China’s Jiangsu province – had paid for the cat to have so-called double eyelid surgery.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Shaggy dog story about four-legged friend really takes off</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Local broadcaster Jiangsu TV picked up the story and in its report on Wednesday said the woman – whom it did not identify – had spent 10,000 yuan (US$1,500) on the procedure, which is popular among East Asian people and involves the reshaping of the upper eyelid to create a crease in it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The report included interviews with members of the public, many of whom were outraged by the alleged actions of the cat’s owner.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite their protestations, veterinary surgeon Liu Xiaoou, who works at the AMC Veterinary Hospital in Nanjing, said on Thursday that the story was almost certainly fabricated “nonsense”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Giving his opinion of what the online images showed, he said: “It is clearly a surgery to treat an inverted eyelid.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Do not say that it is cosmetic surgery, just to attract views and provoke the public,” he wrote on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The media these days is really stupid, unkind and without morals or sense.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">“The media these days is really stupid, unkind and without morals or sense.”Vet Liu Xiaoou</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some social media users were quick to dismiss the TV report.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After two days [the broadcaster] will say it got things wrong, the cat had surgery because of an ingrown eyelash,” read a highly rated comment on Weibo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A colleague of Liu’s at the veterinary hospital was among those keen to debunk the report.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking in a video shown on Pearvideo.com on Wednesday, the vet, surnamed Wu, said: “It is a stye surgery. From the photo, you can see that part of the upper and lower eyelids have been removed all the way to the corner of the eye.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This kind of surgery would only be chosen in the case of an eye disease.
