We purchased my great-grandmother's land of 18 acres and built a small home there. We started adding livestock, like chickens and eventually goats. We had goats for a couple of years before we started making goat milk soap."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/20210924_084142.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2019, they began making small assorted goat milk soaps for friends and family to give as gifts, and with much praise, they began flirting with the idea of making more.

From feeding the goats, hand milking to making the soap, we do it all by hand. They're also made with goat's milk, making a creamier soap bar. Goat's milk is also good for you. It's full of nutrients and vitamins, and it's a good wholesome product."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Polish_20210627_151142207.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Polish_20211007_172612610.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For Kimberly, making a healthy and safe product for her kids is essential.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She says,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"We use essential oils and natural colorants, so there's nothing toxic or synthetic involved. We use goat's milk, we have lye, and then we also use olive oil, coconut oil, and castor oil. If it has a scent, it's an essential oil. Then we also use natural colorants like Mater root or Tumeric, to enhance the colors."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Polish_20200517_175713282.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their most excited about bringing their children up in an environment that encourages them to create with their hands and possibly create a family legacy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She remarks,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"I would love to provide a successful business to pass on to my children if that's what they would like to do in the future.
