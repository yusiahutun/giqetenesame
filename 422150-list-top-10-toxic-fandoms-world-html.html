However, that is just how the <a href=#>world</a> operates – an invention comes up, people get hooked and hardly survive without it. One of the most outstanding advantages of the internet is connecting with various people from different parts of the world. And if you are looking for a platform with like-minded individuals who share similar interests, then a fandom can do. The culture has been on the rise, but, in some cases, it has turned out to be toxic. What are the most toxic fandoms in the world in 2022?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4d89567e78ab0719.jpeg><p class=align-left>Don't let the face value of a fandom fool you; there is more to it than meets the eye. If you don't join the community, you will never know. Most people look for a platform where they can freely share their opinion without anyone scolding them. However, some fandoms have a deep and dark element.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7e95f383b5a00693.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best quotes from To Kill a Mockingbird that will blow your mind</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As much as fans love being part of fandoms, they are also some of the reasons people who are hardly aware of the topic discussed stay away. A collection of toxic fans can create hate and disharmony. Which are the most annoying fandoms in the world in 2022?</p><h2>10 most toxic fandoms in the globe in 2022</h2><p class=align-left>Fandoms are great platforms for people with the same interests to interact. However, some members can be rude and answer specific questions with disgust. And if this goes for a while, with the support of other members, then the fandom can be toxic.</p><p class=align-left>Even though most fandoms don’t start as places of toxicity and hatred, there is a high potential of taking that direction. So what is the most toxic fandom in 2022?</p><h3>1. Naruto</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7e95f383b5a00693.jpeg><p class=align-left>Naruto is a popular anime that finished airing years ago. However, its end hasn't stopped fans talking about it. Naruto has the most considerable number of toxic anime fans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d671c898771deb92.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 biggest fandoms in the world you should check out in 2024</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The platform is so toxic that the hostile group has earned itself the name Naturads. This means that that they have irritated many people to get a unique title. In addition, the toxic fans on the platform often refer to other anime as a rip off of Naruto.</p><p class=align-left>It isn’t strange to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">find comments </a>such as:</p>Black clover? Naruto rip off!Jujutsu Kaisen? Bro, it's totally Naruto!Izuku Midoriya? You mean green Naruto?Sees a ninja in any anime* “IT IS A NARUTO REFERENCE!” (As if ninjas were not originally from Japanese history.)Naruto is better than any anime out there because even your mom would know about it– the poor thing that doesn’t know just because it is mainstream and popular doesn’t mean it is the best. (It is good, yes, but not necessarily the best.)<p class=align-left>They not only trash characters from other anime but from the show itself. They don't realize that every character is entitled to their characteristics, regardless of what one might think about them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0a721d60b5080cdd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ famous Ethiopian proverbs about love, life, and education</span></p></a><h3>2. Barbz (Nicki Minaj fandom)</h3><p class=align-left>Don't dare comment about Nicki Minaj, as fans will come down on you like crazy if you don't know anything about Nicki Minaj. It is one of the most toxic fandoms in the world for newbies and anyone who has an opinion that others would consider defamatory to the famous <a href=#>musician</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The Barbz are fiercely loyal. A great example is when a writer for British GQ explained how Cardi B had adopted Nicki Minaj's style in a much more accessible way. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">She wrote</a>:</p>Nicki Minaj intimidates, Cardi B endears.<p class=align-left>Of course, this did not go well with Nicki Minaj fans, who responded with an all-out attack on the writer. The attacks were so toxic that some fans threatened to kill her. They even threatened that if she doesn't delete the post, they will hunt her and her <a href=#>family</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56b57511c8b74b1b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 meanest celebrities in real-life according to fans</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nicki Minaj fans don't tolerate any comment that defames their queen, and unfortunately, people have found out the hard way. That is why they are one of the worst fans online, as they hardly tolerate criticism.</p><h3>3. Swifties (Talyor Swift fandom)</h3><p class=align-left>Who knew that <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> would have a big fanbase of loyal fans that don't tolerate negative comments about her? The singer's fans are not bad, but they love her so much and are a bit over-the-top about it, making them extremely sensitive. Who can blame them? The pop star that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sends them holiday presents</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Among this group of fans, some are toxic and complain about many things. For instance, they go on a rant when Taylor Swift doesn't get nominated for enough awards.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, there are white supremacists. These fans call Taylor Swift an Aryan goddess and give her a bad reputation. They make the fandom one of the worst in the world.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6ae6aefc19bc97c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Karen haircut: What is it and why should you avoid it?</span></p></a><h3>4. Zack Snyder fans</h3><p class=align-left>Zack Snyder fans have had it rough, and their attitude tells it all. <a href=#>The star</a> director occasionally blinks out and makes good and sometimes not-so-good movies, according to critics.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, <i>Dawn of the Dead and Watchmen</i> were highly acclaimed. However, certain films like <i>Sucker Punch, Man of Steel, </i>and<i> Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</i> have been trashed by critics. This hasn’t gone well with his fans that have been going online to express their discontent.</p><h3>5. Rick and Morty fans</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2e6fa970df8049d2.jpeg><p class=align-left>Rick and Morty is a funny, intelligent, and challenging cartoon. People have compared it with Futurama. The fandom, on the other hand, isn't so lovely as they are pretty toxic. Most fans boast how the show is so intelligent, and there is none comparable in its category.</p><h3>6. Metalheads</h3><p class=align-left>Metalheads make the list of the most cancerous fandoms in the world. They are opinionated people with a superiority complex like no other. They have numerous obsessive qualities and are quick to aggression. Of course, not all are like this, but the majority bring out this toxic element.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c8171740444f9650.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kush Tracey: 10 hottest photos you should check out</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In most cases, metalheads try to shove their taste on other people and have long arguments that go along the line, “Why don’t you listen to real music like metal?” “Aren’t you a metal fan?”</p><p class=align-left>The worst thing is that metalheads fail to acknowledge the existence of other genres, which makes them hate. And the hatred is channelled to people that are hardly familiar with <a href=#>metal music</a>.</p><h3>7. Football fans</h3><p class=align-left>Football fans are crazy about the sport and, in most cases, only have harmless conversations with one another. However, a small percentage, likely 10% of the community, are toxic and make it one of the bad fandoms in the world.</p><p class=align-left>The insults go as far as physically harming one another because of personal preferences. There have been instances in Europe and America where fans have killed or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attacked each other because</a> of conflicting opinions.</p><p class=align-left>Some football clubs are infamous for racial slurs against certain players the accusers don't want in their club.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d3a44e99b18c64e5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dashiki origin, history, and cultural significance</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Recently, during the Euro 2020 games, toxic fans abused certain players in the England national. They went as far as personally attacking the players on their social media platforms. This was just an example of how toxic football fans can get, but, in most cases, the sports discussions are friendly and entertaining.</p><h3>8. Nintendrones</h3><p class=align-left>Does Nintendo have the worst fanbase in the world? It could be as the fans are sometimes toxic to the core. The firm produces games and consoles and has an obnoxious fanbase.</p><p class=align-left>Over the years, Nintendo has been making some wrong moves that have negatively affected their business model, but the fans remain docile to its poor decisions. Instead, they attack anyone that attempts to point out the company's faults.</p><p class=align-left>Nintendo fans think of the company as the Holy Grail of gaming, and they insult other gamers for choosing other consoles or games.</p><h3>9. BTS’ Army</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/91eb86fc22cebbe4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Famous South African proverbs and sayings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>BTS’ Army also qualifies as one of the most toxic fandoms in the world. However, the platform didn't start as harmful as it used to be a typical K-pop fandom. It was alright during the first 2-3 years after <a href=#>BTS</a> debuted in 2013. After that, the fandom grew fast and became one of the biggest in the world, considering the massive global success the K-pop group has had over the years.</p><p class=align-left>BTS fans are toxic because of how they treat people not affiliated with them and other K-pop groups. They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lash out openly</a> at anyone that dislikes or criticizes BTS. Some even go further and send insults and threats to specific individuals. They are good at rallying up a mob and going against a person, harassing them to the end.</p><h3>10. Star Wars fandom</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d671c898771deb92.png><p class=align-left>The Star Wars fandom has its ugly dark side full of racism, misogyny and death threats. A great example is Vanity Fair's Joanna Robinson’s story. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote a review </a>about <i>The Last Jedi</i> in 2017. She had the following to say about the feedback she got from fans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/50a1f03dccf6b22c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Blippi's net worth, sources of income and salary in 2022</span></p></a>One thing…that got a lot of negative feedback was my exploration of mansplaining, what Laura and Dern and Carrie Fisher's characters had to deal with.<p class=align-left>Fans reacted by telling her to kill herself and hurled various insults at her.</p><p class=align-left>Also, the writer/director, Rain Johnson's Twitter feed was full of deranged messages from disgruntled fans that did not like the film. Johnson also received death threats over the movie, which was quite bizarre.</p><p class=align-left>Fandoms are fantastic when people only share ideas and experiences without going dark. But, the most unfortunate thing about fans is that there will always be a certain proportion that cannot tolerate criticism. And as they grow in numbers, they make the fan base to be toxic. So, it is a good idea to stay away from the most toxic fandoms in the world if you want to have some peace of mind.</p><p class=align-left>Are you wondering about the most beautiful flags in the world? <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> featured an interesting <a href=#>article</a> about the aesthetic appeal of the flags of different countries.
