According to <a href=#>various reports</a>, Aldridge was recently arrested in Mississippi after police responded to a call of a suspicious vehicle. Upon investigation, they found Aldridge passed out inside.</p><p>After a trip to the hospital, 27-year-old Aldridge was arrested for possession of Oxycodone, Lorazepam, Xanax and drug paraphernalia. <a href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;has obtained a copy of the police report that originated in Natchez, Miss.</p><p>It’s a sad piece of a story that had Spears pregnant at the age of 16 years old with Aldridge’s baby. Spears also dealt with the subsequent cancellation of her Nickelodeon show Zoey 101 and in 2008, she gave birth to her daughter, Maddie, while still engaged to Aldridge.</p><p>Aldridge also has another daughter, 4 year old Skylar, with his ex-wife, April Watson.</p><p>In February of 2017, Maddie was involved in an <a href=#>ATV accident</a> where she was seriously injured but went on to make a full recovery. Just last year, Spears’ sister Britney announced that she would be taking a <a href=#>break</a> from the spotlight as her and Jamie Lynn's father Jamie battles a life-threatening disease.</p><p>Spears' personal and professional life has also had its share of bright spots. She has pursued a country music career through the years, even performing at <a href=#>CMA Fest </a>in 2017. She also married Jamie Watson in 2014 and had a <a href=#>baby girl with him</a> named Ivey Joan in April of 2018. On Sunday (Feb. 17), Spears shared a happy pic of the family.</p><p><strong>Country Stars Who Have Experienced Tragedy</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mdnrJuuNinpWaroJqus7%2BMnq9mm5Gosrp5wKWbq6GUnLJurdGrnKyslZl6pb7UoKpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
