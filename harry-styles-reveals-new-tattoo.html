The <a class=hm-link href=#>One Direction</a> singer, 20, was spotted&nbsp;splashing around in a&nbsp;pool in Brazil with his friends, including band mate <a class=hm-link href=#>Niall Horan</a>, when he unveiled his new inking. Showing off his bare torso, Harry looked like he was having a whale of a time flicking his head back and soaking up the sun. The star successfully attempted a back flip from the edge of the pool, much to his and his friends' delight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/41c7f78c1e4f-harry1-z.jpg><p id=ec7-xXj1s5SN data-wc=6><strong>Harry Styles flaunts his new tattoo</strong></p><p id=eOAym6vY5eAM data-wc=38>The new leafy tattoo was hard to miss, having been&nbsp;printed across Harry's lower abdomen. The inking perfectly mirrored the pair of swallows already etched onto Harry's chest, and sat just under his design of a large butterfly.</p><p id=ebQwQjH5FBu3 data-wc=47><a class=hm-link href=#>GALLERY: One Direction's tattoo collection</a>It looked like Harry hadn't foreseen his quick dip in the water, as his friend had playfully shoved him into the pool. The toned singer was in hysterics as he resurfaced, trying to take off his clingy T-shirt and clutching at his hat as it floated away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6a09cc002cb2-harry2-z.jpg><p id=erC9bICeQrX4 data-wc=11><strong>Harry Styles has previously admitted he "regrets" some of his tattoos</strong></p><p id=ejSHjye5PMKI data-wc=60>Harry's new tattoo comes just two months after the Worcestershire-born hunk debuted a graphic <a class=hm-link href=#>inking of an anatomical heart</a> on his left bicep. The body art was designed with valves, aortas, ventricles and all. As the most tattooed One Direction band member, Harry has previously admitted that he regretted some of his artistic choices, which include one of a padlock, a 99p sign and squiggles.</p><p id=e--c_IyXn1fh><a class=hm-link href=#>GALLERY of celebrity tattoos: David Beckham, Lady Gaga and more&nbsp;— the meaning behind the art</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c9d6d79bc6f8-harry3-z.jpg><p id=eVOMHuAYHnGl data-wc=11><strong>One Direction kicked off their international tour in Columbia last month</strong></p><p id=e0mdfTbo3a45 data-wc=113>Harry, Niall and their group of friends were at the luxury Hotel Fasano in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While Harry had enjoyed his refreshing dip, Niall preferred to stay dry and worked on his tan from the sundeck. Dressed in striped swimming trunks and a sleeveless white top, the Irish singer lay back on the lounger and looked completely relaxed. One Direction kicked off their tour of South America in Columbia at the end of April, with Harry tweeting, "Columbia, thank you so much. You were the perfect way to start a tour. It's been a while and you were incredible. Love x." The five-man band then travelled to Peru, Argentina and Brazil.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbWduaGhmhXeAk2ifmqqirnq0wNilnKxloprDpq3LrGSnnadiwaLA06imaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
