How Long Was He Sick?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>After his sudden death announcement and a life filled with controversy, many people might be wondering <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1751031/oj-simpson-last-words/>what kind of cancer did OJ Simpson</a> have. The former football player talked about his health in the past year.</p><p>Simpson was born on July 9, 1947, in San Francisco. He rose to fame as a standout football player at the collegiate level, playing for the University of Southern California (USC) Trojans. Simpson won the Heisman Trophy in 1968, awarded to the most outstanding college football player in the United States.</p><p>That would all be overshadowed by the events in 1994, when his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, were&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">found murdered outside Nicole’s home</a>&nbsp;in Los Angeles. Simpson quickly became the prime suspect in the case, which sparked a media frenzy. The subsequent trial, known as the People v. O.J. Simpson, lasted for nearly nine months from 1994 to 1995.</p><p>It was one of the most widely publicized trials in American history, broadcast live on television and closely followed by the public. His defense team,&nbsp;<a href=#>led by prominent attorneys like Robert Kardashian</a>&nbsp;and Johnnie Cochran, successfully argued that Simpson was framed and that evidence was mishandled by the police.</p><p>Despite substantial evidence against him, including DNA evidence and <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/451119/every-actor-cast-in-fx-people-versus-oj-simpson/>circumstantial evidence</a>, Simpson was acquitted of all criminal charges on October 3, 1995. The verdict was met with widespread controversy and debate, with many believing that Simpson had gotten away with murder.</p><p>In a subsequent civil trial in 1997, Simpson was found liable for the wrongful deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman and was ordered to pay millions in damages to their families. However, he has maintained his innocence in the murders.</p><p>Simpson was also involved in several other crimes in 2007 where he was arrested for stealing sports memorabilia and was convicted on charges of multiple felony counts, including criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, assault, and robbery. He was sentenced to 33 years but was released in October 2017.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.7678347934919><h2>When did OJ Simpson die?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/oj-simpson-last-words.jpg><p>According to his family’s statement made on April 11, 2024, he died after a battle with prostate cancer. “On April 10th, our father, Orenthal James Simpson, succumbed to his battle with cancer,” his family shared in a statement on X. “He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren.

My health is good. Obviously, I’m dealing with some issues but I think I’m just about over it and I’ll be back on that golf course hopefully in a couple of weeks.”</p><p>In May 2023, Simpson posted a video on X revealing that he’d recently “caught cancer” and “had to do the whole chemo thing.” He added, “It looks like I beat it.” Simpson didn’t specify the nature of the cancer.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.2324510932106><h2>How many people are diagnosed with prostate cancer?</h2><p>Prostate cancer&nbsp;can be screened for with a blood test called Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA).
