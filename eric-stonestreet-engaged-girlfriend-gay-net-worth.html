That's a good thing for you because you're a hypochondriac"</strong>, and many more.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who Is Eric Stonestreet's Girlfriend?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Eric Stonestreet’s now fiancé, Lindsay Schweitzer, is a&nbsp;<a href=#>pediatric nurse</a>.

Even though he played as gay on the television, he is straight in real life&nbsp;while his partner Tyler is gay. Eric even said to Oprah.com,&nbsp;<strong>“I say I’m ‘openly straight. I never thought this would be the character that people would know me for, but it’s just an honor to play him.”</strong></span></p><p><span>They met each other for coffee on Valentine’s Day to discuss their roles after they found out they are going to play as a gay couple; his partner Jesse said about him,&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>“Eric is straight. I call him gay-for-pay. He is so game for this character. We just clicked. We hang out a lot. Ironically, after he got the role, we decided to meet up for coffee. We’re having coffee in the middle of the afternoon – and we realize that it’s Valentine’s Day! Just two guys, hangin’ out, having coffee. No big deal.”</span></strong></p><p><span>He was&nbsp;<a href=#>asked the question</a><strong>,” How difficult is that to play as someone who isn’t gay?”</strong> where he replied,&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>“It’s not that much of a deal because I’m an actor and play all kinds of roles. The fact Cam is gay doesn’t have much to do with anything. I played bad guys on TV before, other guys before, so it’s a character I get to play and never really thought too much about it.”</span></strong></p><p><span>It's clear that he was gay in his role only but not in his real life.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Eric Stonestreet</strong></span></h2><p><span>An American comedian and actor, Eric Stonestreet, has a&nbsp;<a href=#>net worth</a>&nbsp;of $23 million.
