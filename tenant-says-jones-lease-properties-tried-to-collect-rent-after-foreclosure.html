She said someone from Jones Lease Properties called her today looking for payment — a payment Drewery thought was supposed to go to the new property management company that took over when the bank foreclosed on her house.&nbsp;</p><p>She still has the letter from the bank that told her any more payments need to be made to the contracted property manager.&nbsp;</p><p>“It just really upset me that they were trying to collect money from us that’s already been sent somewhere else,” Drewery said.</p><p>It’s only Drewery ‘s latest frustration with Jones Lease Properties.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Her family lived in the house for more than two years and it has problems: the basement floods, there’s a hole in the kitchen ceiling and Drewery said the foundation is weak.</p><p>“they’ll send somebody or they’ll give us the run around and since February of this year haven’t really had anything done,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Drewery is now looking for a new home for her family, but she keeps seeing familiar signs.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s for rent signs,Jones Lease Properties or JP Rentals, and nobody knows what they’re actually getting into,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>She’s warning people like her to stay away.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a mess. It’s a mess that I wouldn’t wish on anybody,” Drewery said.&nbsp;</p><p>Local 4 News spoke with an employee at Jones Lease Properties Monday. He said our stories about the company were one-sided and “gossip.” We told him this was his opportunity to get their side out there, but he ultimately said the company had not comment and did not want to be contacted anymore.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46tnKeZnql6tK3YrGSjp56awG64xJqqnmWgp7yxsdGtoJ6rXam%2FqrHDZquoZZOkua2xwq1kq52eqXqistOeqWaen6eypLjOrKyrnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
