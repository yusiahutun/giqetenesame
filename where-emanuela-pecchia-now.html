He fell into notoriety after doing transplant operations involving plastic windpipes infused with stem cells. It was a groundbreaking due to regenerative medicine when it was launched. However, when patients started to die as a result of the surgery, many eyebrows were raised.</p><p>Shortly after Macchiarini implanted the windpipes in several of his patients, NBC reporter Benita Alexander was assigned to do a Meredith Viera special surrounding the doctor. Alexander and Macchiarini fell in love and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>were engaged</a> without knowing that Macchiarini had a wife. Macchiarini planned to marry Alexander with The Pope officiating and with lavish guests like Barack Obama and Elton John. Things went south after Alexander was tipped off by a friend that the Pope was not even in the country and she started to question his practices. To her discovery, she found out that Macchiarini was still married and did not file for divorce.</p><p>“This was not some guy I picked up in a bar. This was a renowned, accomplished, established surgeon whom we had followed all over the world.” Alexander told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vanity Fair</a>&nbsp;on why she didn’t question him. “The very prospect of him making all of this stuff up, even as I described it to friends as surreal and overwhelming, seemed too ridiculous to give it any credence. Why would he risk his reputation by doing that? What reason could he possibly have to lie to me, someone he obviously loved, in that manner?”</p><p>Alexander then messaged the Karolinska Institute where Macchiarini had been working about his <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1329784/where-adnan-syed-now/ rel="noreferrer noopener">professional practices</a> and after thorough investigations, he was dismissed from the institute and later charged in court.</p><p>So what happened to Paolo Macchirini’s wife Emanuela Pechia now?

It’s not known where Emanuela Pecchia is now or if she is still with Macchiarini since their marital status is unknown. They have two children together, a boy and a girl. Machiarini reportedly had another affair with Ana Paula Bernardes — the mother of one of his transplant patients — and had a child together.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexander went to Spain with her friends to confront Macchiarini about all his lies on the day that was supposed to be their wedding day. The former NBC reporter stayed in the car while her friends talked to Macchiarini and his wife. Macchiarini reportedly “could not meet their gaze”, and acted “like an embarrassed schoolboy who had been caught.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=14.84858044164><h2>Where is Paolo Machiarini now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bad-surgeon-.png><p>Where is Paolo Machciarini now? Paolo Macchiarini is currently serving a 2 1/2-year prison sentence in a Swedish prison after he was sentenced for causing the death of three people between 2011 and 2014 per the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Associated Press</a>.</p><p>He initially had been sentenced to no prison time by a lower court. Swedish police charged with manslaughter, but the case was soon dropped due to a lack of sufficient evidence. However, in 2023, the Svea Court of Appeal concluded that there were no emergency situations among two of the three patients who later died, while the procedure on the third could not be justified.</p><p>“The patients have been caused bodily harm and suffering,” the appeals court said. The patients “could have lived for a not insignificant amount of time without the interventions.”</p><p>In March 2016, Macchiarini was fired from Sweden’s Karolinska Institute for breaching medical ethics. He was accused of falsifying his resume and misrepresenting his work.</p><p>After the trial, Macchiarini said that he was being treated like a “a war criminal.”</p><p>“The intention of harming is the most awful accusation that you can make to a doctor,” he said. His colleagues and supervisors all approved of the surgeries, he said: “In the operating room we were 20, 25 people. What surprises me is, why I am here alone?” He continued, “We did the transplant in good faith.” Macchiarini and his lawyer Bjorn Hurtig said they would appeal the sentencing.</p><p><strong>Bad Surgeon: Love Under The Knife</strong>&nbsp;is now available to stream on Netflix.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWmvsRmnKaZnqqyra2MqZycm5ierm66zrBm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
