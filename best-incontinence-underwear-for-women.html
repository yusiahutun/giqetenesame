While it’s most common in women over the age of 50, pregnancy, and even UTIs can trigger the condition. Although there weren’t a lot of stylish options years ago, more undergarment companies are meeting the demand for leak-proof, moisture-wicking underwear.

Similar to periods, one can deal with mild to moderate to heavy urinary leakage.</p><p>Mild urinary incontinence can sometimes be brought on by physical stress like exercise or sneezing. In these cases, you’re not fully voiding your bladder, and a pad may be all you need until you make it to the bathroom. Here are a few brands to try:</p><p><strong>Incontinence pads</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Rael Organic Cotton Reusable Incontinence Pads, $29.99</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Honey Pot Organic Cotton Non-Herbal Incontinence Pads with Wings, $12.45</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Attn: Grace Heavy Incontinence Pads for Women, $23.97</a></strong></li></ul><p>Those who have moderate to heavy incontinence do better with briefs, since they can hold a higher volume of liquid.</p><p>Ultimately, finding the best incontinence underwear will be about the type of incontinence you’re experiencing, and the type of leak protection you need. Fortunately, there’s a good chance you’ll find them in a style you like with many period panty companies designing looks that also work for the condition. Here are a few of our favorites:</p><ul><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Knix Leakproof Period Underwear</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">The Period Company</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Saalt</a></strong></li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the best incontinence underwear?</h2><p>The best incontinence underwear all depends on your specific needs. For light bladder leakage, period panties may do the trick. Now, you may be thinking, “No, thanks” as a result of <a href=# rel=noopener>Thinx’s recent lawsuit settlement</a>. However, the effects of PFAS (per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances), which were found in the brand’s period underwear, aren’t clear. In an interview with Well + Good,<a href=# rel=noopener> Kelly Johnson-Arbor, MD</a>, further explains.</p><p>“For PFAS, even some of the human studies have been inconclusive,” said the Medical Toxicologist. “Since almost 100 percent of people living in developed countries have detectable levels of PFAS in their bloodstreams, it is challenging to determine exactly what adverse health effects are attributable to PFAS and not another chemical or environmental exposure.”</p><p>Period panties are lighter than adult diapers, are made for leakage absorbency, odor control, and look and feel like regular underwear. If you’re curious about them but fear sketchy materials, check out the ones from <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Saalt</a></strong>. They work for light bladder leakage, as well menstruation, and spotting.</p><p>For heavier protection, something like these <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong>incontinence underwear from Amazon</strong></a> may do the trick. They’re made from 100 percent cotton, are fragrance-free, and can hold up to 150 milliliters of liquid.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the most absorbent incontinence product?</h2><p>Along with underwear designed for bladder leakage, there are other incontinence products that provide proper protection. One of the most absorbent and highly-rated products is <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Poise Fresh Protection Overnight (Amazon, $39.90)</a></strong>. The curve shaped pads have a wider front and back for coverage, and have an absorption rate one reviewer on Amazon called “superior.”</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>company’s site</a>, the incontinence product holds two cups of liquid, has four layers of absorbent material, plus a breathable cover to keep the wearer dry. It has more than 10,000 reviews on Amazon, half which give the product five-stars. If you’re not a hundred percent sold on period underwear or incontinence panties, these are worth consideration.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best Incontinence Underwear for Women</h2><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Knix Super Leakproof High Rise</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best overall incontinence underwear for women</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Untitled-design-2023-06-13T143450.062.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Knix, $34</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Moisture-wicking gusset</li><li>Flexible material</li><li>Waterproof layer</li><li>Available in 12 different colors</li></ul><p>Highly-rated in effectiveness, the <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Knix Super Leakproof High Rise</a></strong> are so fashionable, no one would expect they were period panties.

The <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Postpartum Support Heavy Flow</a></strong> underwear. It holds up to a quarter cup of liquid and features a thicker center to trap fluid. Fortunately, you can’t feel it like if you were wearing a pad, and the sustainable Tencel modal is breathable. A good option for moderate incontinence, the undies will keep you dry and comfortable up to 12 hours. The gusset is a bit higher, which helps to prevent overflow when you move, so even if you can’t get to the bathroom quickly, no one should be the wiser.</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Jockey Worry Free Microfiber Moderate Absorbency Brief</a></h2><span class=block-product__eyebrow>Best plus size incontinence underwear for women</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Untitled-design-2023-06-14T154128.818.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Kohls, $17</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Absorbs 25 milliliters of fluid</li><li>Available in a variety of colors</li><li>Innovative 3-layer system</li></ul><p>Who doesn’t love a fresh new pair of Jockey underpants?

I decided to try these, and I absolutely love them. It would be wonderful, however, if they padded area was a little longer because the urine can go up higher than the padded area.
