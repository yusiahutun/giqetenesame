He was going to be Money Mike, and Katt Williams was going to be the Santa Claus,” Williams said.</p><p>"We auditioned in Los Angeles. I was audition No. 201. Two-hundred Black comedians auditioned for the role of Money Mike with me. You’re saying all 201 of us was auditioning, and you had already had the role and had already shot the role in four days?"</p><p>After his initial experience working with Smiley, Williams shared that he stipulated on his contract that, moving forward, he would only work with Smiley if the role required Smiley to wear a dress.</p><p>True enough, in their subsequent film together, First Sunday, Smiley sported a dress.</p><p>"Now, what was Rickey Smiley’s next movie? Was it ‘First Sunday’? Did he wear a dress in it? You bet he did. It’s in my contract.” Williams continued.</p><p>"That’s where he’s a believable actor. Him and Tyler Perry can’t play a man to save their life. They play good women.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/rickey-smiley-hosts-21st-annual-869758323.jpg><p>Elsewhere in the podcast episode, Williams branded Smiley, Steve Harvey, and Cedric the Entertainer as cliquish.</p><p>"For 30 years, they're a group. These aren't three random guys," he said. "All of these dudes are co-entwined and they share secrets, and this is the age of truth."</p><p>He even accused Cedric of stealing his "best joke," and Harvey of ripping off The Steve Harvey Show's plot from comedian Mark Curry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What have fans said about the Club Shay Shay podcast episode?</h2><p>Fans were shocked by Katt Williams' statements, but many offered their support on <a href=#>social media</a>.</p><p>One commented: "I like how Shannon allowed him to speak his mind. Outstanding content! Katt spoke with conviction!"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Another said: "So honest, love Katt Williams, speak your truth."</p><p>Others were also impressed that he had no holds barred: "Katt went full on Scorched Earth mode… this one gone ruffle plenty of feathers!!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hpYGV9eoGVaWakmaSperi1y6WgmqWjYr%2Bqr8qesGarnZ65psWMnKOuml2otaLFjKyfmqaepLtuv8eaqamdXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
