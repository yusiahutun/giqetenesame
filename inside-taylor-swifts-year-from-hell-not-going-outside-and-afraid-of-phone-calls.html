Taylor Swift’s feud with Kanye West reached a new peak and Kim Kardashian, then wife of the rapper, stepped in. Years after the ‘bleak moment,’ Taylor is now recalling the incident and the ‘career death’ she faced following the release of an ‘illegally recorded phone call.’</strong></p><p>Between 2016 and now, the ‘phone call’ drama has been revisited several times, especially when footage of Kanye and <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>‘s call discussing his song Famous was leaked in March 2020. Both parties, Kanye’s wife Kim Kardashian and Taylor responded at the time. Taylor claimed the footage proved she was “telling the truth the whole time about&nbsp;that call,” Kim still insisted that ‘she is lying.’</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-486026796-1024x685.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-finally-addresses-the-kim-kardashian-drama>Taylor Swift finally addresses the Kim Kardashian drama</h2><p>Taylor is unstoppable in 2023 and has been <a href=# rel=nofollow>named</a> Time’s Person Of The Year. Speaking of the dark moment during her career, she admits it felt like it had all come to a stop.</p><p>She shares: “Make no mistake—my career was taken away from me.”</p><p>“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” she claims.</p><p>“That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year.”</p><p>Taylor went on: “I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”</p><p>Between the backlash trending on <a href=#>Twitter</a> and people calling her a ‘liar,’ Taylor said there felt like there was no hope of coming back from the apparent cancellation that she faced.</p><p>“I thought that moment of backlash was going to define me negatively for the rest of my life,” she admits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-486016502-821x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-truth-is-stranger-than-fiction>Truth is stranger than fiction</h2><p><a href=#>Kanye West and Taylor Swift’s feud</a> started a decade back on the stage of 2009 VMAs. It was where the Bad Blood crooner won her first <a href=#>MTV Video Music Award</a> and Kanye chose to interrupt the <a href=#>music</a> icon on stage while she received the award.</p><p>But later in 2015, it looked like both parties were ready to make peace, as Taylor presented the prestigious Video Vanguard Award at the 2015 VMAs to Ye.</p><p>First forward to a year later, the drama resurfaced with Kanye’s new song Famous where the rapper included lyrics about the pop star. He sang “I made that b—h famous’ about Tay Tay, and the <a href=#>celebrity</a> denied approving that line.</p><p>In reply to that, Kim Kardashian released a clip where it looked like the Donda maker was discussing the song’s lyrics with Taylor and she seemingly agreed. Although, the call did not have the footage of Kanye mouthing the word ‘b***h’ in it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-full-video-appears-years-later>Full video appears years later</h2><p>Fast-forward to 2020, complete footage of the 25 minutes of Kanye’s phone call showed Ye did discuss the lyrics with Taylor, but the word ‘b***h’ was never used.</p><p>Taylor fans took it as proof of ‘the truth’ and the singer responded through an <a href=#>Instagram</a> story at the time.</p><p>She was trying to divert the attention to a good cause stating: “Instead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about&nbsp;that call&nbsp;(you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that somebody edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years)… SWIPE UP to see what really matters.” Taylor posted, linking out to Feeding America and World Health Organization.</p><p>Instead of playing up to the drama, Taylor remained quiet over several years over the ordeal. She didn’t mention the Kardashians or West at opportunities she could, and chose to shed light on an important cause instead.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2WEcLXNrKCdnV2prrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8G0ediemKtllqe8rnnHnqOlZZ6kwW6zzqKloGWfqsG0tcOeZJqmlGKup77Aoptmp5Zivam7zZ5knJmcocBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
