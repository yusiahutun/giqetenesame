It’s based on the book of the same name by Ali Novak and follows Jackie (Nikki Rodriguez) who became an orphan after a devastating accident. She moves to Colorado to move in with her now guardian and her mom’s best friend Katherine Walter (Sarah Rafferty) who has nine boys with her husband George (Marc Blucas). When all of a sudden Jackie is involved in a love triangle between two of the Walter boys: Cole (Noah LaLonde) and Alex (Ashby Gentry).&nbsp;</p><p>The book was originally written as a Wattpad novel when Novak was 15. “There’s always something to be said about<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1616333/who-belly-end-up-with-summer-i-turned-pretty/> love triangles, </a>but it was inspired by Damon and Stefan from The Vampire Diaries,” Novak told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://ew.com/the-vampire-diaries-love-triangle-inspired-my-life-with-the-walter-boys-8412320 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>. “There’s just something so compelling about a love triangle, and there’s so many YA books that have been influenced by that show.”&nbsp;</p><p>As to why they wanted to put the novel on <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1616407/why-belly-conrad-break-up-the-summer-i-turned-pretty/>the small screen,</a> creator Melanie Halsall said, “It’s coming of age. It’s discovering yourself. It’s coming to terms with the difficulties life can bring you. It’s found family. And the TV series takes off a little bit from the book — there are fewer boys in the family, for a start. Two of the twin sets became just one, and that’s quite a big change I think people will notice.”</p><p>Though some book fans might be seeing some differences on the way. “We have to make changes to make it work as a TV series,” Hallsall explained. “The way that relationships unfold, especially Jackie and Alex’s relationship, is slightly different than in the book. And what happens at the end will surprise people because that is different than the book, but I’m hoping that gives the audience, both the audience that loves the book and the new audience, a bit of a surprise.”</p><p>So will there be a My Life With The Walter Boys season 2?
