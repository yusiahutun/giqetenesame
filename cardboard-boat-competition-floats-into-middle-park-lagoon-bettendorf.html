Six schools and more than 50 students will compete. The public is welcome.</p><p>The 30 or more boats will be on display at 9 a.m. at the lagoon shelter. Administrators and teachers will&nbsp;also square off with their designed boats about noon. Bettendorf High School Principal Kristy Cleppe will compete in her own boat this year.</p><p><strong>Regatta Cardboard Boat Race</strong></p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: To build a one-person vessel made from the construction of cardboard. It must be maneuverable and stay afloat for approximately 600 yards.</p><p><strong>Rules</strong>:</p><li>The boat must be constructed solely of cardboard including any means of powering boat. (Ex: Paddles,&nbsp;oars, paddle wheels etc.)</li><li>The exception to this rule is in the joints of the boat. Any type of fasteners or adhesive can be used in&nbsp;the joint area as long as it doesnâ€™t increase the structural integrity of the boat. In other words the&nbsp;reasoning for the fastener is to seal joints and connect cardboard. Not to reinforce the boat!</li><li>The boat can be made waterproof with any liquid water sealing as long as it does not increase the&nbsp;structural integrity. No covering boat with duct tape, plastic, or fiberglass. Paints, water sealers and water&nbsp;sealants are acceptable.</li><li>The boats will be timed from launching point until the return to the launching point.</li><li>Students will be disqualified if any part above their elbows and any part above their knees enter the&nbsp;water during the course of the race. Students can maneuver boat with hands and feet as long as it does&nbsp;not exceed body parts described above.</li><li>Boats will be displayed and checked by judges in front of the shelter at Lagoon Middle Park.</li><li>All operators must wear a life jacket that will be supplied in order to compete.</li><li>Any questions concerning rules must be clarified by race day.</li><li>Transportation of boats will be worked out with individual schools.</li><li>Removal and cleanup of boats is the responsibility of boat owners and individual schools.</li><li>Students must be ready to launch boat at their designated times or could be subject to disqualification.</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJqaqpSXvKK%2Bw2aZqJmkYrCwuc%2Beq6KsmaS7brLLqJitq12eu7W7jKagnZycmnqxrdGkZKWZl6S8r3nBnqutnZ6ZvLOyjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
