"They think they can say whatever they want and be a jerk, or that they don't have to take as much responsibility. They think they have to do less physically, and so they do less. And you end up kind of diminishing yourself; you have no purpose. Whereas I think it has nothing to do with how old you are. There might come a time when I can't do as much; we're all getting older, these bodies aren't built to last, but there's no point in speeding that up, or using it as an excuse to be lazy or irresponsible."</p><p>He said that while he didn't see his body change in his fifties or sixties, he did notice a difference once he turned 70. He was "visited by Mr. Jiggles," his name for sudden belly fat that appeared.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8cae82f7-47a3-4d1f-b90f-808d04ac7e4f data-container-ref=toofab:article:a8a7ba41-0c31-4dfc-ab87-062b48d4b223 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bf/5by4/2022/09/20/bff82f2ccbbc4082812b73e305c8a637_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Quantum Leap Premiere Recap: All the Nods to OG Series, How Dr. Song's Journey Is Different</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Fasting didn't get rid of Mr. Jiggles. He just hung in there, you know, and he talks to you at night. He whispers, 'We need to eat something'. And suddenly, I'm feeding Mr. Jiggles. So a couple of years ago, I thought, 'I need to get to the gym.'"</p><p>However, the recent response over his physique is not distracting the veteran actor from his goals and mindset, referencing Dick Clark's journey with getting older.</p><p>"He always looked amazing. It seemed to me he looked like a perpetual teenager, until one day he didn't. And we don't know what the future holds," he said. "Maybe one day I'll wake up and, well, who knows. So I'm not concerned with living as long as possible. I just want to live as full and complete a life as I can, to enjoy the time I have, to live a good life, and be an example of what God can do."</p><a id=gallery-link-490f1756-f699-4a99-9d7d-9d25142ece5e class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:490f1756-f699-4a99-9d7d-9d25142ece5e data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:a8a7ba41-0c31-4dfc-ab87-062b48d4b223 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fb/4by3/2024/04/15/fb24da6a64f34637bbc0b88edbbf7d6d_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21mam5fmr%2BvtcRmn66co6S7brvNZpmem5%2Bitq%2BzjJpkraCZp8C1edOrmKllkal6eXyMspyaqqNivK2wjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
