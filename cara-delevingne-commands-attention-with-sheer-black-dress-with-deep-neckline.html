The 31-year-old model and <a href=#>movie</a> star kept her look minimal with a diamond necklace and platform heels, keeping the focus on her plunging neckline. The dress also had a deep side slit and showcased her long legs effortlessly.</p><p>Cara carried her signature kohl eyes with a red lip, matching her best friend <a href=#>Taylor Swift,</a> who is also often sported wearing a red lip on most occasions. The Paper Towns star kept her hair short with a side-parted bob away to keep it away from her face, making her appear sharper and fierce, very on-brand for the actress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1693877307-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cara-delevingne-s-journey-of-self-recovery>Cara Delevingne’s journey of self-recovery</h2><p>Cara has spoken out about her years of battle with substance use, but the movie star is looking at a different life in her 30s. The star has been candid in talking about the changes that helped her recovery, including her friends who became a crucial part of her healing.</p><p>Gushing over her friendships in the past, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “They ride for me and I love my friends so much, but it felt like a lot of the time, they were shallow relationships only because I wasn’t able to be honest about the things I was going through. I didn’t want to burden anyone. It was also like, What if people leave? If you ask any of my friends, they would say they’d never seen me cry.”</p><p>“From September, I just needed support. I needed to start reaching out. And my old friends I’ve known since I was 13, they all came over and we started crying. They looked at me and said, ‘You deserve a chance to have joy.’”</p><p>The road to recovery is not always pretty but what helped Cara is an honest approach.</p><p>She added: “I’ve had interventions of a sort, but I wasn’t ready. That’s the problem. If you’re not face-first on the floor and ready to get up again, you won’t. I just kind of pushed everyone away, which made me realize how much I was in a bad place.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-talk-to-someone>Talk to someone</h2><p>Speaking of the ‘work’ that one needs to put on herself, Cara adds: “I always thought that the work needs to be done when the times are bad, but actually the work needs to be done when they’re good. The work needs to be done consistently. It’s never going to be fixed or fully healed but I’m okay with that, and that’s the difference.”</p><p><strong>If you’ve been affected by this story, you can contact American Addiction Centers on (877) 686-7688.
