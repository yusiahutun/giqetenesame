In an industry that thrives on opacity, the writer, producer and Black Panther star has consistently spoken out on subjects that are often considered taboo. Five years ago, she delivered the Mac-Taggart keynote address at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, candidly detailing the systemic discrimination she experienced at drama school and on the production of her own comedy Chewing Gum, not to mention the remarkable moment she turned down a one-million-dollar deal from Netflix in order to retain the rights to her multi-award-winning drama series I May Destroy You.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I’ve not known another way to be," she says. "Being transparent about my feelings has been the key to my success. I don’t feel it’s damaged my career in any way, so that’s what I encourage others to do. I think being honest and compassionate is what leads to better relationships, and better work."</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Master the Art: Michaela Coel on how to tell a story" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/mota-thumbnail-michaela-1605025200.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Coel is typically generous with her advice and connections. In a recent conversation with Nicôle Lecky (whose series Mood has drawn comparisons with Chewing Gum for its originality and vision), Coel congratulated the young writer-director on becoming the executive producer on her own show. Coel herself was prevented from having this title in the making of Chewing Gum, despite having conceived the project and being involved in every aspect of its production. "The most beautiful scenario would be that only one person has to experience the struggle, and from then on, it’s easy," she says. "My dream is that it never happens again."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Visibility, therefore, is important to her. Coel is a pioneer in many ways, having worked up to a position where she can be seen and heard; she was the first Black person for five years to attend the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, and the first Black woman – and only the fourth woman in its 42-year history – to give the Mac-Taggart lecture (previous speakers include Rupert Murdoch and Jeremy Paxman).</p><img alt="michaela coel master the art women of the year" title="Michaela Coel - Master the Art - Women of the Year" width=667 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2020-09-24-harpersbazaar-michaelacoel-123-rtv2-preview-1605081931.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It’s 'seeing to believe'," she says firmly. "When I was growing up, I never saw a picture of a Black woman sitting in a director’s chair. I didn’t know that was something that we could do, so it almost wasn’t something that I wished for. I just kind of stumbled here."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Coel’s creative journey has been defined by a strong sense of self rather than premeditation. Given her stratospheric success, it’s reassuring to hear that at each moment in her career, she never imagined an audience bigger than the one that was before her. "I’ve been writing for 16 years," she explains. "At no point did I ever think ahead, when I was writing poetry in my car or turning up at theatres doing open-mic nights for 50 quid – and that was only if you won. The most important thing is your relationship with your creativity. That can be difficult to nurture in a world that is very into things like social comparison, but I see it as crucial to encourage people to focus on what’s in front of them."<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>People grill me about my choices; that has helped me understand why I do what I do <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This spring, Coel is helping to launch the BMW Filmmaking Challenge in partnership with the British Film Institute. She will mentor five shortlisted filmmakers, who will each receive a £10,000 production budget and access to cutting-edge technology to make their project. The winner will have a red-carpet premiere at the London Film Festival in October, and the shortlisted entries will be screened.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Coel sees this an opportunity to reach as many communities as possible, and to give writers creative space to take risks. "I want to impart that it’s OK to get it wrong, it’s OK to mess it up," she says. "And we should be allowed that space."</p><img alt="michaela coel" title="michaela coel" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jan22-d091-ep01-022-1-1594133524.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span><p>Coel in the ’I May Destroy You’ series</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition, she wants to enable those taking part to have control over their stories and to trust their own voices. "People ask me questions, they grill me about my choices, trying to force me to make a choice that they would prefer," she says. "That has really helped me understand why I do what I do.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It would be great to allow creatives to see that the questions are not threats, and the questions are not negatively critical. They are trying to help you strengthen your relationship and belief in your own voice. That’s the thing that excites me the most."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.bmw.co.uk/bmwfilmchallenge data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The BMW Filmmaking Challenge in partnership with the BFI will open for entries in March 2023" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The BMW Filmmaking Challenge in partnership with the BFI will open for entries in March 2023</a>.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSyr8DEq6uaoZ6isq%2FAjppra29hbH10hY6moJygkZq5onnCqJylZZmjwaa%2B1aKcsGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
