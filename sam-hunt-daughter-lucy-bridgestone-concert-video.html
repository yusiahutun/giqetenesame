The five-time Grammy nominee had the crowd in the palm of his hands as he belted out the words to some of his most notable songs.</p><p>However, there was one audience member in attendance&nbsp;who specifically caught Hunt’s attention.</p><p>On a solo stage&nbsp;away from the main platform, Hunt, with guitar in hand, sang acoustic versions of his hits like “Cop Car” and “Take Your Time." While serenading fans, a fan's footage caught Hunt’s oldest, daughter Lucy, staring up at her dad.</p><p>As the “Outskirts” singer headed to the floor stage, he made time to&nbsp;squeeze in a quick hello to his wife, Hannah, and their first baby girl.</p><p>In the first video, you can see Hannah holding little Lucy, capturing a photo of the two with Hunt performing in the background.</p><p>Later on, Lucy didn’t leave her dad’s side, staring up at Hunt as Hannah pointed to him for Lucy from across the stage.</p><p>Lucy is the older of Hunt and wife Hannah’s two children:&nbsp;They also have a son, Lowry, who was born in 2023.</p><p>The proud dad has plenty of Lucy content on his social media — in many photos you can find Lucy propped up on her dad’s hip.</p><p>Hunt was joined by <a href=#>Brett Young</a> and <a href=#>Lily Rose</a> for his first headlining performance at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville. The singer held nothing back in his live show, complete with a bridge that raised up as he sang “Water Under&nbsp;the Bridge."</p><p>Hunt kicked off his Outskirts Tour Feb.&nbsp;22, in Grand Rapids, Mich. This tour follows his previous&nbsp;stint with Young and Rose, who&nbsp;also joined him&nbsp;on his Summer&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Outskirts Tour.</p><p>“I sat back for the last three months and enjoyed every second of the time I got to spend with these wonderful people,” Hunt shared on social media at the end of that run. He loved it so much, he wanted to do it again.</p><p>The&nbsp;star is headed for round in Sioux City, Iowa, Milwaukee and Peoria, Ill. next.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Country Stars Who Had Babies in 2023</h2><p>Say cheese!
