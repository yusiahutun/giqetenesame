Last night, the rapper-turned-designer debuted a new campaign for his Yeezy 500 Supermoon sneaker campaign on Twitter, and it turned heads to say the least.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The shots feature a diverse roster of models wearing West’s new footwear, along with other Yeezy pieces like sports bras, leggings, and sweatshirts. But a few models really wore nothing but the shoe. One of them included adult-film actress Lela Star (who has an uncanny resemblance to West's wife, Kim Kardashian).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The campaign was photographed by Eli Linnetz (who shot the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card). He shared another revealing angle from the shoot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Clermont twins also made an appearance, wearing only the Supermoon sneakers, socks, and biker shorts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There was also this faceless model, who posed topless but sported grey shorts, Calabasas socks, and Yeezy kicks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not all models were nude. Some wore Yeezy's signature oversized sweaters and biker shorts (à la Kim Kardashian), others even sported jeans.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The roster also included younger-looking models, including a child.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This isn't the first time Kanye has launched a new campaign on social media. For his recent collections, Kim has worn his design in public and shared the paparazzi photos online to debut the clothes. He also enlisted other models including Paris Hilton, Amina Blue, and Sami Miro to pose as Kim lookalikes for the shots, resulting in a full-on social media swarm.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
