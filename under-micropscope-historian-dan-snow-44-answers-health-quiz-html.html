I did a crash diet in 2008 as I was 10kg over the weight limit for the ejector seat in the RAF Typhoon (I was covering the RAF’s 90th anniversary). I lost it in ten days. But then I started to fixate about food. It took a year or two to get over it. I think dieting is really bad for mental health.</p><img id=i-dbbef52a75a10799 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/12/27/00/65950391-11575259-Historian_and_TV_presenter_Dan_Snow_44_answers_our_health_quiz-m-2_1672099304619.jpg height=370 width=634 alt="Historian and TV presenter Dan Snow, 44, answers our health quiz" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Historian and TV presenter Dan Snow, 44, answers our health quiz</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Any vices?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I definitely drink too much — a beer after work with the team, rosé in the summer, red wine in the winter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Any family ailments?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mum and Dad [his father is TV journalist Peter Snow, 84] are still very well.
