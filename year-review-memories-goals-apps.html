The concept is brilliant, and the daily commitment is beyond minimal.</p><p>This app asks you to capture the most meaningful second of every day—a great meal, a serendipitous coincidence, a moment of celebration, or anything else that you'll want to remember as you look back in coming years.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>1 Second Everyday teaches you to appreciate the simple things in life, even on boring, nondescript days. A ladybug on your windowsill? A million-dollar smile on your kid's face? When the right moment comes, you'll know it viscerally.</p><p>This is one creative way to record all of the things in your life that actually matter to you, even if you're not exactly the artsy type.

Having a year's worth of digital diary entries viewable at a glance makes it easy to chart your journey and see how far you've come. We love DayGram's electronic ink theme and minimalist appeal, both of which are customizable.

But FoodView isn't a strict diet tracker.</p><p>Instead, FoodView is a simple, photo-based food diary app. It documents nothing aside from the date, the time, and the photo that you took.</p><p>This app is like foodie Instagram solitaire. If you've got an online presence and social brand to maintain, you can use Food View to collect all of your favorite miscellaneous bites without spamming your feed. Snap a photo of a spontaneous yet memorable weekday tossed salad or the cheeky Ferrero Rocher that topped off a cozy evening at home.</p><p>It's a much less granular (and potentially more productive) way to pay more attention to what you eat and lean toward healthier options. If logging every ingredient of every meal hasn't stuck for you as a habit, a simple photo log might be enough for you to decide in favor of some bright green vegetables over a salty, fatty side.</p><p><strong>Download: </strong>FoodView for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> (Free)</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=polarsteps>4.

In addition, you're free to add any trips that you took before installing the app, complete with photos and videos.</p><p>The tracking functionality of Polarsteps should only cost you an additional 4 percent of battery life during your trip, on average.
