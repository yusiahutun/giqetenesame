From his <a href=#>long-lost sister Megan’s surprise return</a> to his (finally) <a href=#>divorce from Dr. Amelia Shepherd</a>, fans are now dying to know more about the actor behind it all: <a href=#>Kevin McKidd</a>. Scroll down to get all your questions about him answered!</p><h2>Where is Kevin McKidd from?</h2><p>On Aug. 9, 1973, Kevin was born in Elgin, a town in northeast Scotland. He also grew up in Scotland, having attended all his schooling there. When it came time for college, he went to the University of Edinburgh and then transferred to Queen Margaret College, both of which are in Scotland.</p><h2>Does Kevin McKidd have an accent?</h2><p>Are you ready to be mind-blown? Kevin, 44, has a full Scottish accent — and he has to hide it during every episode of Grey’s! That’s honestly talent. Kevin sounds so different with his accent, and it’s so impressive that he’s able to masque it on the show. Here’s another shocker: his co-star, Camilla Luddington, hides her British accent on the medical drama, too!</p><h2>Is Kevin McKidd married?</h2><p>No, the actor ended his 17-year marriage to ex-wife Jane Parker in July 2016. “Kevin and Jane have jointly decided to end their marriage. They look forward to continuing to co-parent their children, who have been their top priority, and will to continue to enjoy a close and caring relationship,” the star’s rep said in a statement of their divorce. The couple — who reportedly split in October 2015 — previously married in 1999.</p><h2>Does Kevin McKidd have kids?</h2><p>Yes, he’s a dad-of-two! He was two kids, son Joseph, 17, and daughter Iona, 15, with Jane. Iona is one lucky teen, as she gets to <a href=#>visit the Grey’s Anatomy set</a> with her famous dad from time to time!</p><h2>How tall is Kevin McKidd?</h2><p>Kevin is actually a lot taller than we imagined! The actor stands at 6 feet tall. It’s so hard to tell on TV, isn’t it?</p><p><b>Click through the gallery below to see the <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> cast then and now!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46gqZ6xo2Kur63TqKSyZZuaw6q6jKaapKGUmXq4tcWeZJ2hpqS%2FpLGMamdvcWhrfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
