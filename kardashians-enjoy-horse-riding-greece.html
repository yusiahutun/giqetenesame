The girls were joined by Kendall's father Bruce and his son Brody as they went for a gentle horse ride on the idyllic island of Mykonos. The youngest Kardashian sister Khloe, 28, has a lifelong passion for horses and looked at ease atop her pony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/454b5d7c4eb2-kardashians-greece-z.jpg><p id=eR52WzIVVwo_5 data-wc=4></p><p id=elBWOawLeEMd9 data-wc=122>"I personally love them," she wrote on her blog. "I grew up riding and I also owned horses so any chance I get to be around them is really exciting for me." Khloe, 28, was dressed for equine action in a black and beige ensemble. Kendall, 17, dazzled in an all white outfit underneath the gentle Greek spring sunshine. Her big sisters <a class=hm-link href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a> stayed away from the horseplay. Kim, who is expecting rapper <a class=hm-link href=#>Kanye West</a>'s baby in July, no doubt gave the risky activity a miss because of her pregnancy. But Kourtney "is not comfortable at all around horses" according to horse lover Khloe's blog. The gentle ride took place on Fokos beach, a tranquil stretch of sand on the island's north coast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/49122f2ad37a-kardashians-greece5-z.jpg><p id=e8bGOpTXKwk4m data-wc=4></p><p id=ehM2ajbh4BKmB data-wc=170>Their mum and manager <strong>Kris Jenner</strong> also chose to stay away, probably to keep Kim company and enjoy the rest that the paradise isle has to offer. It's been a fun-filled week for the Kardashian-Jenner clan as they film scenes for the eighth season of the ever-popular reality show. As well as a spot of horse-riding, the group have been seen quad biking and jet skiing. Mum-to-be Kim has been taking things easy though, and has shared Instagram snaps with nearly 18m Twitter followers of stunning sea views and intimate family snaps. Kim's time on the family break was cut short when she flew to Paris to be with Kanye, who is currently recording an album in the French capital. The rest of the party are expected to remain in Mykonos until the end of the week. They have taken over the impressive My Mykonos retreat, according to reports. The luxury beachside hideaway features three separate villas with breathtaking views over the South Aegean sea.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
