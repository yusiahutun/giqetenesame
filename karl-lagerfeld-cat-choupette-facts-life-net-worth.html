It was love at first sight." Another time, he joked to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/choupette-karl-lagerfeld-cat-scli-intl/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CNN class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">CNN</a> that if he could marry his cat, he would.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The artist sadly passed away on February 19, 2019, leaving behind his precious pet. But this year, the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a42552063/2023-met-gala-explainer-how-to-watch-co-chairs-theme/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Met Gala" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Met Gala</a> will honor his legacy—and Choupette will join fellow celebrity guests in celebrating his life and career.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, read everything to know about the world's most glamorous cat.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She was gifted to Karl.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Choupette was originally owned by French model Baptiste Giabiconi—one of Lagerfeld's main muses—who named the Burmese after the French nickname for "cute girl," the model <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/style/karl-lagerfeld-choupette.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhat%20happened%20to%20Choupette%3F%E2%80%9D,and%20is%20surrounded%20by%20love.%E2%80%9D" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=revealed class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">revealed</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2011, the designer was asked to cat-sit for the holidays while Giabiconi took a visit to Marseille. Despite initial apprehensions about the pet's fur, he acquiesced when Giabiconi assured him that cats "take care of themselves." He ended up enjoying his time with Choupette so much that Giabiconi let him keep her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Soon following the adoption, Choupette went viral, as V Magazine Editor-in-Chief (and Lagerfeld's good friend) Stephen Gan, officially introduced her as Lagerfeld's new cat on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.glamour.com/story/karl-lagerfeld-got-a-kitten data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Twitter class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Twitter</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My love for little furballs came to me quite late," Lagerfeld told Numéro in an interview conducted in French in July 2016. "I had dogs before in my life, but that was when I lived in the countryside. In Paris, as in all big cities, it's always a bit complicated. As you can imagine, I can no longer afford to walk a dog down the street without it bordering on a riot. And then a dog is far from clean and spotless, and when it rains, it smells of dead rats. I had two friends who owned a cat, and they always did loads of them in the overflowing kind of affection, so much so that I found it frankly ridiculous. Well, now I'm much worse."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed, Lagerfeld told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/choupette-karl-lagerfeld-cat-scli-intl/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CNN class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">CNN</a> that he would marry the feline if it were legal. "There is no marriage, yet, for human beings and animals," he said. "I never thought I would fall in love like this with a cat."</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She is celebrity-acquainted.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thanks to her late legendary owner, Choupette has been in the presence of many influential figures over the years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On April 26, Kim Kardashian shared several selfies on Instagram of her spending time with the feline in Lagerfeld's office. "Had a date with <a href=# role=link tabindex=0 data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/choupetteofficiel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@choupetteofficiel class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@choupetteofficiel</a> in Paris," the shapewear mogul wrote. "We then spent some time at <a href=# role=link tabindex=0 data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/karllagerfeld/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@karllagerfeld class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@karllagerfeld</a>’s office to get a little inspiration for the Met."</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She is among the world's most opulent cats.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The designer's beloved Burmese has lived a lifestyle nearly as luxurious and chic as his, and following his death, she is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11974877/Late-designer-Karl-Lagerfelds-beloved-CAT-Choupette-receive-1-3-million-inheritance.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=rumored class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">rumored</a> to inherit a portion of Lagerfeld's €200 million net worth. Though, shockingly, that does not make her the richest cat in the world (Taylor Swift's Scottish Fold, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_Tb8N4DyKM/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=abdddd60-3742-4aae-9b73-3d3dc39b398a" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Olivia Benson" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Olivia Benson</a>, beats her with a reported worth of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.businesstoday.in/visualstories/industry/worlds-richest-pets-taylor-swifts-cats-net-worth-rs-800-cr-equalling-ranbir-alias-combined-net-worth-17538-09-01-2023 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$97 million" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">$97 million</a>), she is certainly still amongst the wealthiest, and arguably the favorite within the fashion world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Throughout her lifetime, the booked-and-busy feline has graced several magazine covers—including that of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/news/a26188/karl-lagerfeld-choupette-and-i/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harper's Bazaar UK" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Harper's Bazaar UK</a> in 2013—and even had her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/07/karl-lagerfeld-cat-choupette-makeup-book data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="own line of makeup and a book" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">own line of makeup and a book</a> about her life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She has traveled by private jet, alongside a handful of bodyguards, agents, chefs, and personal assistants. And she dined across from Lagerfeld every evening, during their time together, in the designer's Paris apartment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lagerfeld told Numéro in 2016, "Now that she is an adult, she eats at the table with me. She sits across from me and only eats what she needs to eat. Before, she used to attack a shrimp, but now she only touches her four different dishes that are prepared for her the same day, served in lovely bowls. Everything has to be fresh, otherwise Mademoiselle sits in front of her croquettes in sauce for three quarters of an hour, giving me murderous looks, without touching them."</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She still lives a lavish life in Paris.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 11-year-old Burmese currently lives in Paris and is now owned by Lagerfeld's former housekeeper, Françoise Caçot, who has since dropped her nanny role to care for the feline full-time.</p><img alt="choupette lagerfeld cat francoise cacot paris instagram" title="choupette lagerfeld cat francoise cacot paris instagram" width=1080 height=1350 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/328520425-851428705949579-8260844979419536863-n-644a8ea316875.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Choupette Lagerfeld / Instagram</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Instagram</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Caçot currently runs the feline's verified Instagram page—<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/choupetteofficiel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@choupetteofficiel class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@choupetteofficiel</a>—which has racked up 150K followers. The active account regularly features snapshots of Choupette in her day-to-day, plus throwback moments with Lagerfeld (many shot from the designer's phone)—and captions meant to be first-person notes from "Choupette" capturing her point of view on anything and everything.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just like how Lagerfeld would have wanted, Choupette continues to live a pampered lifestyle under her former nanny's care. Courtesy of Caçot, the cat's 11th birthday was celebrated last August on a private jet with balloons and champagne.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef84b592-a2b0-47e0-8e6c-e29e8d3ddc25_1619719162.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sabrina Park" title="Headshot of Sabrina Park" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sabrina Park is a Digital Fellow at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpersBAZAAR.com</a> where she covers news, fashion, and culture stories.
