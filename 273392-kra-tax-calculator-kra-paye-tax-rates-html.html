Many Kenyans don't know how their PAYE is calculated, and sometimes, there might be incredible misinformation in public about the rates.</p><p class=align-left>It would be best if you kept in mind that the Kenya income brackets, as specified by the revenue collector, pay different tax rates. And if you earn more than the lowest band, your proportion of that amount is charged the same. Get the idea?</p><h2>KRA PAYE tax calculator</h2><p class=align-left>Pay as You Earn (PAYE) refers to tax deductions from wages and salaries from employment. PAYE in Kenya applies to bonuses, salaries, commissions, wages, directors' fees, or any other income from work.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b76e421108d47c70.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>MPs Seek KSh 1.1m Monthly Pay, Additional KSh 2.5m for Sleek Cars as Economy Bites</span></p></a><p class=align-left>PAYE also incorporates housing value as long as it is employer-provided. However, the deductions do not apply to someone engaging in casual employment (employed for less than a month).</p><h2>Kenya income tax brackets</h2><p class=align-left>There are five tax bands, or what is also referred to as tax brackets. The taxable income increases by 11,586 (monthly income) except for the last group, where the tax rate rises by 5% from one tax band to the other.</p><p class=align-left>The minimum taxable income comes from the lowest earners (Ksh.12,298 and below) who pay a tax rate of 10%, while the highest band (from Ksh.47,059 and above) give 30%. The following are the applicable monthly tax brackets and PAYE rates in Kenya:</p><ul><li>Up to Ksh12,299: 10%</li><li>Ksh.12,299 – Ksh.23,885: 15%</li><li>Ksh.23,886 – Ksh.35,472: 20%</li><li>Ksh.35,473 - Ksh47,059: 25%</li><li>Above Ksh.47,059: 30%</li></ul><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>KRA</a> personal relief for every employee every month is Ksh.2,400 that translates to Ksh.28,800 per year.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0f7f6816c29a5c97.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Employers Reject Uhuru's 12% Minimum Wage Increase, Warn of Industrial Action</span></p></a><h2>What income is taxable?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b76e421108d47c70.jpg><p class=align-left>Before delving into the details of the new income tax rates in Kenya, it would be a great idea to know how KRA arrives at the taxable income amount.

This means that these amounts are not included in your taxable amount and are deducted before putting it into the KRA tax calculator.</p><h3>Retirement contributions</h3><p class=align-left>You may have probably heard of National Security Social Fund (NSSF) or, as many call it, <i>malipo ya uzeeni</i>. The monthly NSSF contributions range from KES 360 to KES 1080 per month. Apart from NSSF, private contributions to pension schemes qualify for tax deductions of the least of 30% of pensionable income or Ksh.20,000 or 30% of pensionable pay.</p><p class=align-left>If you earn a salary of Ksh. 20,000 and <a href=#>NSSF</a> is the only deduction; your taxable income would be Ksh.18,920 (Ksh.20,000 - Ksh.1,080).</p><h3>Owner-occupied interest</h3><p class=align-left>Another deduction to consider when using the Kenyan tax calculator is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mortgage relief</a>. As of 2017, KRA increased the mortgage relief to Ksh.300,000 per annum (Ksh.25,000 monthly) from Ksh.150,000 a year on loan interest.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e2a008b4f9bf58e6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto's Offices Spent KSh 8b on Staff Salaries in 2020, Up by 282 Per Cent</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Remember, the mortgage relief is only applicable if the property is residential (you live there). If you have a loan from National Housing Corporation, Housing Finance, or any other approved bank, you can claim deductions as long as you prove the loan fulfilled the intended purpose.</p><h3>Homeownership savings plan</h3><p class=align-left>The KRA tax calculator PAYE also factors in deposits on home savings plans. Suppose you are making contributions towards owning your home under a registered home savings plan. In that case, you qualify for a deduction of up to four thousand Kenyan shillings a month, provided the terms and conditions apply. However, the deductions are for a maximum of nine consecutive years.</p><h3>Tax relief</h3><p class=align-left>Kenyans are allowed to deduct from their tax burden two tax reliefs (personal relief and insurance relief) under PAYE.</p><h4>1. Personal relief</h4><p class=align-left>Every Kenyan is entitled to tax relief of Ksh.2,400 per month or Ksh.28,800 every year. These figures became active from April 25, 2020.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f8c6519bfcdabdcc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Parliament Proposes a Raft of Measures to Reduce Fuel Prices</span></p></a><h4>2. Insurance relief</h4><p class=align-left>All taxpayer residents are eligible for insurance relief in Kenya. By law, the insurance relief is equivalent to 15% of premiums paid but for a maximum of Ksh.500 per month. The insurance should be for life, education or health. Also, the insurance relief shouldn’t exceed Ksh.60,000 per month.</p><h2>How to use KRA online tax calculator in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>Now that you know the theoretical elements of tax payable on taxable salary, how about a mathematical view of the same. The best way of doing this is by utilizing the KRA PAYE calculator that you can access <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">online</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Suppose your gross pay is Ksh.30,000 per month and that you make contributions to NSSF (new rate of Ksh.1,080) and <a href=#>NHIF</a> (Ksh.750) only; your net salary will be something similar to the image below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0f7f6816c29a5c97.jpg><h3>1.

Refer to KRA PAYE tax rates to know your income tax bracket.</h3><p class=align-left>Ksh.28,920 falls in the third band of the new income tax rates in Kenya.
