During an interview with The Post Millennial, Tragni said: “what really drove me to do it was the donation factor.” He also stated that he wanted to find “the best way to one, help out veterans that are being really mistreated and two, utilize this movement for better,” before adding, “There's this 'Let's Go Brandon' movement; there has to be a coin out there and there was nothing there.”</p><p>$FJB's Twitter account says, “The Official Let's Go Brandon Crypto Coin (Ticker $FJB).

The most recent example of this was the 'Squid Game' crypto coin where the developers sold their tokens and made off with an estimated $3.3 million.&nbsp;A fan of the conservative political commentator tweeted about the possible scam, saying, "Candace, I really respect your opinion and think we agree on a lot but this memecoin is a scam. As someone who speaks so loudly about freedom you should focus your attention on #bitcoin instead :) - happy thanksgiving!" Sharing a screenshot, a user asked, "Care to comment why you’re misleading thousands by cropping a screenshot?"</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Candace, I really respect your opinion and think we agree on a lot but this memecoin is a scam.
