And while it was reported to be just <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>a casual hookup</a> at first, the singer and reality star later hard-launched their relationship after a wild night in Vegas.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, a source told People that the two were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>"all over each other at a nightclub,”</a> and afterward, they got <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>matching lightning bolt tattoos</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Avril Lavigne, Brody Jenner.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Marc Piasecki/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From there, things progressed quickly, and a month later, they got another set of his-and-hers tattoos — this time, they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>spelled out “FUCK” on their ribcages</a> (Avril's favorite word). In July 2010, Brody and Avril got each other’s names inked on their bodies (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>his on his arm in her handwriting</a>, and hers on her torso), and they also share the Roman numerals XXV tattooed on their forearms.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from their frequent trips to the tattoo parlor, Avril and Brody also shopped at Kitson on Robertson Boulevard, went bowling, and had cute coffee dates during their two-year courtship.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them: </strong>&nbsp;He was a boy, she was a girl — can I make it any more obvious?</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Avril Lavigne, Brody Jenner.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jean Baptiste Lacroix/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their relationship was the age-old theory of opposites attract — except in this instance, Avril was the punk-rocker, and Brody was the one with a reputation as a preppy playboy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> The time they went on a double date with another iconic 2010s couple: Brody’s stepsister Kim Kardashian and her then-boyfriend, Kris Humphries.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:&nbsp; </strong>Two years and four tattoos later, Avril and Brody called it quits on their relationship in January 2012.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, a source confirmed to E! News that the breakup was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"a mutual decision,"</a> while another insider at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Us Weekly </a>claimed the reason for the split was because of their clashing careers. "Every time he wanted to come back and take meetings to get his career back in order, she would make him go to Asia and Europe," the source said, adding: "He hasn't worked, and he wants to. They were both unhappy because he wants to have his career. She wants him to stay with her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after reports speculating on why they broke up began to surface online, Brody took to Twitter to clear the air. "It really upsets me to read all the FALSE!! stories," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>tweeted</a>. "Avril has always been there for me and is the closest person to my heart. I love her."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Avril Lavigne, Brody Jenner.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jerritt Clark/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lavigne tweeted back, "luv u 2!!! @BrodyJenner."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;After breaking things off with Brody, Avril began dating Nickelback's lead singer, Chad Kroeger, in July 2012, and one month later, they were engaged. They wed the following year but divorced after just two years of marriage. Lavigne then dated Phillip Sarofim, the son of Texas billionaire Fayez Sarofim, in 2018, as well as indie musician Pete Jonas in 2020. She was recently engaged (and then un-engaged) to Mod Sun earlier this year and was linked to rapper Tyga around the same time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Avril released her fifth studio album Avril Lavigne in 2013 — her last, before taking six years off from making music due to her intense battle with Lyme disease. In 2019, she released Head Above Water, and three years later, her seventh album, titled Love Sux.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brody had a fling with model Bryana Holly in 2013 before he met his future wife, Kaityln Carter, later that same year. The pair married in 2018 but filed for divorce the following year. Jenner is now engaged to surfer Tia Blanco, and they are expecting their first child together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following years of reality TV, Jenner switched career paths and became a DJ in 2014 when he began performing at venues with his friend and fellow DJ William Lifestyle. In addition to music production, Brody is also a spokesperson for the tequila brand Mamitas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">#TBT: Check in every Thursday as we throw it back to some of our favorite celebrity couples of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705urZpmmp7atecuaraKfnpp6o77OnbBmopWju6a%2BjKucpZmknryvv8eip2ZvZWuGcoGV</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
