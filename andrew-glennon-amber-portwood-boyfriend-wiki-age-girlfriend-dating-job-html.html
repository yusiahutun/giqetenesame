A Short Wiki of&nbsp;Andrew Glennon:</h2><p>It was not long ago that Amber Portwood called it quits with her former man, Matt Baier. But just two months after the split with Baier, Amber was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> seen kissing</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;tall and handsome man&nbsp;in her hometown, Indianapolis in August 2017, who was identified as&nbsp;Andrew Glennon.&nbsp;</p><p>So that only meant one thing, she had moved on from Matt and found new love in her life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><img alt height=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/celebrity/Amber%20Portwood%20new%20boyfriend.jpg width=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Caption: Amber Portwood has a new love in her life, Andrew Glennon.</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Photo Credit: eonline.com</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But who is&nbsp;Amber's new love? What is his job? How old is he? These are the questions currently popping inside the minds of her fans and media.</p><p>Andrew is professionally involved in the production field in films and television,&nbsp;and it was also reported that he and Amber first crossed paths while working on the sets of "Marriage Boot Camp." An&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">insider&nbsp;</a>divulged that they gelled pretty well from the get go. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"It makes sense Amber and Andrew grew close during filming. Her relationship with Matt was in bad shape and when you're shooting a show like this where there is a lot of heightened emotion, participants bond with the crew."&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The insider also added,</p><p>"During filming, Andrew noticed Amber before she noticed him. He contacted her once filming ended. She and Matt were broken up and she invited him to come visit."</p><p>So that is how things initiated between them huh? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Speaking of his age, well, he is 33 as per the Twitter post of Amber.</p><p>When a fan questioned their age gap, she tweeted.</p><p><img alt height=184 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/amber-portwood-tweet.jpg width=540 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Furthermore, his girlfriend is not shy about showing&nbsp;her love for her boyfriend on social media.</p><p>[image_deleted_from_Instagram]</p><p>And did you know, he is not really Amber's type, but still they are inseparable from one another?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">source </a>elaborated this in the statement as,</p><p>"Andrew is a little bit nerdy, but she likes that about him. She sounds very happy. He's really tall, well over 6 ft., which Amber loves,"</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>So for those who still are unclear of his job and his professional involvement, we would like to tell you that this guy from Malibu, California, is in the production of film and television and specializes in the camera department.
