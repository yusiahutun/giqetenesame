This thought came into my mind&nbsp;recently&nbsp;when I&nbsp;found&nbsp;a&nbsp;lovely&nbsp;gold ring with an aquamarine&nbsp;gemstone&nbsp;lying in&nbsp;an&nbsp;old&nbsp;jewelry box. The&nbsp;box&nbsp;was&nbsp;a gift&nbsp;from a relative&nbsp;who loves&nbsp;to collect precious gems and treasures.&nbsp;But she also loves&nbsp;her&nbsp;costume jewelry.&nbsp;How could I figure out whether the ring was fake or real without asking and insulting her?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Unless you are a professional, you&nbsp;cannot tell the difference&nbsp;between real and fake jewelry at first glance – even though we all like to think we can!&nbsp;For some expert advice, I&nbsp;asked&nbsp;Robert Diffin of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mendham Jewelers</a>&nbsp;to share his tips, tricks, and knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Tell&nbsp;Fake Gold&nbsp;From&nbsp;Real Gold&nbsp;</h2><p>Looking for easy ways&nbsp;to tell whether your gold is fake?&nbsp;First,&nbsp;check the item for&nbsp;a hallmark, or a <a href=#>stamp in the metal that certifies its purity</a>.&nbsp;If you see a marking that says 10K, 14K, or 18K,&nbsp;that’s a good sign that it’s real gold. European stamps for pure gold&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">are numbers</a>,&nbsp;and they&nbsp;include&nbsp;417,&nbsp;which corresponds to 10 karats,&nbsp;583 for 14 karats, and 750 for 18 karats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another good method is to take&nbsp;out a magnet. If the item&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sticks to the magnet</a>, it contains&nbsp;one or more blended&nbsp;metals&nbsp;beneath either a gold coating or a fake gold coating. In other words, it’s fake, or not pure gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you really have a good idea, the tiny details in the jewelry will give you an indication of whether the gold is real. “We can see the way certain pieces of jewelry are finished, usually up by the clasp,” Diffin says.&nbsp;“Lots of people <a href=#>come in with earrings</a> with all their old gold to sell, and lots of times you’ll see on the earring that there’s a steel post. That tells me right there it’s costume, not gold.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>According to Diffin, the best way to tell is with nitric acid. “The no-fail test is&nbsp;the acid,” he explains. “We put the acid on the stone, and if it eats up whatever just came off, it’s not gold. Or if we put&nbsp;the acid&nbsp;on a piece of jewelry and it turns green in that little spot,&nbsp;it’s not gold.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Spot&nbsp;Fake Gemstones&nbsp;</h2><p>Determining whether a gemstone is&nbsp;synthetic&nbsp;or real is a bit more challenging.&nbsp;To tell real stones from&nbsp;synthetic and imitation&nbsp;ones, Diffin believes you need a very good eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Let’s start with colored stones,” he says. “You look at the color, number one. If it’s supposed to be a sapphire and sapphires are just not that color, you know it’s fake.&nbsp;You look at the cut of&nbsp;the stone. Sometimes it’s way too even. That means it was machine cut and&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;glass. You can tell the way a fake stone is chipped and scratched, compared to how a genuine stone is.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed,&nbsp;impurities or flaws in the stone are a good sign that it’s the real deal.&nbsp;There’s also a good trick for sapphires called&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fog test</a>.&nbsp;If you suspect that a sapphire is glass, breathe on it&nbsp;and let it fog up.&nbsp;Fog will evaporate quickly&nbsp;from real sapphire,&nbsp;because the stone doesn’t hold onto water vapor well. If it’s glass, it&nbsp;will hold onto the water vapor and stay foggy for about five seconds.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Difference Between&nbsp;Fake Diamonds&nbsp;and Real Ones&nbsp;</h2><p>Spotting a fake diamond takes just as much skill and practice as spotting a fake&nbsp;gemstone, if not more so, says Diffin. “When you look into a diamond, it has a certain depth,&nbsp;a&nbsp;density to it that I can see with my eyes and 99 percent of people can’t.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Still, there are a few telltale signs that your diamond is&nbsp;made of cubic zirconia or a similar, inexpensive crystal.&nbsp;“Again, you look at the cut of the stone,” he continues.&nbsp;If it’s cut too perfectly and has zero flaws, there’s a high chance that the stone is&nbsp;fake. Diffin also suggests that you look at the colors the stone reflects.&nbsp;“A lot of fake diamonds have too much color in them, you know, almost like all the colors of a rainbow. And that’s a telltale sign right there,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For solid proof,&nbsp;Diffin pulls out a diamond tester — a small device that can accurately indicate if a stone is a real diamond based on the gem’s physical properties. “The diamond tester&nbsp;tests&nbsp;the density of the diamond. And if it doesn’t go up to a certain number on the scale, it’s not a diamond,” he explains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, if you want to be&nbsp;absolutely certain&nbsp;that your jewelry is real, consult with a professional. “It’s the only way,” says Diffin. “Go to a reputable jeweler.”</p><p>I’ll probably visit&nbsp;one&nbsp;myself to test out that&nbsp;aquamarine ring!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJoo6KelWK1oq%2FKrGatnZyheqetyp5ko52nmrmzxYyfqailXaeyorg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
