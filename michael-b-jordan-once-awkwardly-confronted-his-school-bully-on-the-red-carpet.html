Jordan is one of the most loved actors in Hollywood today, but even someone as cool as himself was ‘bullied’ and teased in his younger days. Years later, he bumped into one of the ‘bullies,’ a host on the red carpet who admitted she ‘teased’ the star with their classmates at school. Awks!</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star has been modeling since he was just ten years old, and by 1999, when he was 12, he landed his first role in The Sopranos. The opportunities then kept on coming for the star, landing a small role in HBO’s The Wire in 2002. Since then, he’s dominated <a href=#>movie</a> screens, appearing in the hit Marvel film Black Panther, and the recent Creed blockbusters.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-1436961150-726x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-michael-b-jordan-awkwardly-confronted-school-bully-on-red-carpet>Michael B Jordan ‘awkwardly’ confronted school bully on red carpet</h2><p>Last year, the actor attended a Creed III premiere event, and bumped into his ‘school bully.’ If that wasn’t awkward enough, she was actually the interviewer.</p><p>“We go way back, all the way back to Chad Science [Academy] in Newark,” The Morning Hustle host Lore’l excitedly exclaimed to the star.</p><p>“Oh yeah, I was the corny kid, right?” the star playfully questioned, referring to a comment the host had made in on her Undressing Room podcast, reminiscing on the early days.</p><p>“You know what’s so crazy? I went to school with Michael B. Jordan at a point in life,” she said in a 2021 episode.</p><p>&nbsp;“And to be honest with you, we teased him all the damn time because his name was Michael Jordan. Let’s start there, and he was no Michael Jordan.” She also revealed the star came to school with a headshot, which his peers poked fun of.</p><p>“We lived in Newark, that’s the hood. We would make fun of him like, ‘What you gonna do with your stupid headshot!?’ And now look at him!”</p><p>Cut back to the red carpet now, the host exclaimed to his ‘corny’ question: “No, you did not hear me say that! I said we used to make fun of the name,” as the 37-year-old revealed he’d heard it. “It’s all good. What’s up?”</p><p>“But yeah, [you are] obviously killing things out here… you’re not corny anymore!” she exclaimed.</p><p>In regards to the corny comment, the host was telling the truth as it was actually her co-host Eva Marcille who said: “I think Michael B. Jordan is just a nice, corny guy.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-></h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-crashed-his-ferrari-and-a-youtuber-s-now-bought-the-damaged-vehicle>The star crashed his Ferrari – and a YouTuber’s now bought the damaged vehicle</h2><p>Although he’s living a life of luxury, no one can have good days 24/7, and in December, the star’s $429,000 was reportedly partially destroyed after it collided with a parked car.</p><p>Now, YouTuber James, known as TheStradman, revealed he bought the damaged car on eBay, negotiating it down to $187,000.</p><p>“She’s not in as bad a shape as I was expecting,” the YouTuber said in his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a> as he plans to fix the car up.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aFcLnInJ%2BanZxir262zqubmqZdpLuksYyarqSvkaexrcWMnKannqKku7Wxw2afoqtdqLCpu86lZJutnKHGbrvNZquhnV2nsqV5wpqpqZ2kZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
