China’s steel production rose nearly sevenfold from 2000 to 2014.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The extreme smog of early 2013 was a clear indication of just how bad the problem had become.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was very clear to China that the export-driven, fossil-fuel reliance development model was not sustainable. It was unbalanced,” said Finamore, now a senior visiting research fellow with the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Some studies show that a large percentage of Chinese GDP growth was getting eaten away … because of the health impacts and the environmental impacts caused by its heavy reliance on coal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The previous approach to GDP growth could not last forever.”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/11/05/web_01.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:45</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Beijing air quality reaches 'very unhealthy' levels as China ramps up coal output</p><p>Beijing air quality reaches 'very unhealthy' levels as China ramps up coal output</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, China has gradually shifted its development model, from pursuing “growth at all cost” to “high-quality growth”, with environmental quality a core objective.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The shift has come from the top, with President Xi Jinping stressing that “ecological civilisation” – or sustainable development – must be an integral part of the country’s social and economic progress.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The concept was written into the constitution and the country stepped up efforts to tackle pollution.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2013, the central government announced that GDP growth – which has long been linked to officials’ promotion – would no longer be the sole determining factor. Two years later, the central government issued a decree, holding local Communist Party officials accountable for environmental degradation under their watch.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China insists it is taking ‘real action’ to tackle climate change after COP26 criticism</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Also in 2013, 74 Chinese cities started releasing their PM2.5 data for public scrutiny, a number that rose to 338 within two years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">China also issued a five-year plan to tackle air pollution, aiming to cut the number of heavy air pollution days nationwide and achieve better air quality in key industrial areas, including the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, vigorous efforts were made to cut coal consumption and rebalance the economy’s reliance on heavy industry for growth. Between 2013 and 2017, Hebei province, China’s main iron and steel production area, phased out 137 million tonnes of iron and steel capacity and 45 million tonnes of coal capacity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The efforts have paid in many parts of the country. In July, Beijing and Hebei recorded their best monthly air quality since records began in 2013. And last year, Beijing’s annual concentration of PM2.5 was less than half its average for 2013.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A change in China was apparent on the international stage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For much of the decade before the airpocalypse, Beijing approached United Nations climate summits as battlegrounds, with Xie Zhenhua, China’s climate envoy and then deputy chief of the National Development Reform Commission, accusing developed countries of using climate issues to restrict developing countries’ development.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the Copenhagen climate conference in late 2009, countries were able to agree on the long-term goal of limiting the maximum global average temperature increase to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But there was no agreement on how to do this in practice, with China among the countries refusing to sign up for a mandatory target for emission cuts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fast forward to the Paris climate summit in 2015 and China had changed its tune. While it continued to stress “differentiated responsibilities” between developed and developing countries, China stepped up to take on greater climate responsibilities and play a more constructive role in the adoption of the Paris accord.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">COP26: more than 100 nations pledge to cut methane, but not China</span></p></a></h3>China worked with the United States to ensure adoption of the 2015 Paris Agreement in which countries agreed to adopt a bottom-up approach to propose their emissions reduction commitments. Under the Paris Agreement, countries pledged to control greenhouse gas emissions to limit <a class="d8-auto-link euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">global warming</span></a> to 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees, by 2100 from pre-industrial levels.For China, addressing <a class="d8-auto-link euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">climate change</span></a> and tackling air pollution were interrelated. “Burning fossil fuels is the main cause of air pollution and it is also the source of greenhouse gas emissions. The two issues have the same cause,” Xie said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Teng Fei, deputy director of Tsinghua University’s Energy Environment Economy Institute, said China had come to a broader understanding of “development” as it took on pollution.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The development we talked about should be high-quality development. It includes economic growth as well as people’s demands of the quality of the environment,” Teng said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Addressing climate change and pursuing sustainable development are consistent with high-quality development, so the changes happened.”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/10/18/thumbnail_clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:38</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">COP26 Glasgow, the UN Climate Change Conference: last chance to save the planet?</p><p>COP26 Glasgow, the UN Climate Change Conference: last chance to save the planet?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The success of the Paris talks rested in large part on the willingness of China and the United States to work together and followed intense diplomatic activity between the two countries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The stage was set in 2013 when Xi and then US president Barack Obama had a two-day informal summit at the Sunnylands estate in California. Then US climate envoy Todd Stern also had frequent exchanges with Xie.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The next year, then US secretary of state John Kerry raised the idea with Xi that the two countries should jointly announce their targets for the Paris climate summit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Chinese were open to it,” Stern said in an interview on a Georgetown University podcast in 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was followed by about nine months of intense negotiations and discussions. On the evening of November 11, 2014, Xi and Obama met in Zhongnanhai – the official work and residential compound in Beijing for top Chinese leaders.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">COP26: China urges US to look at its own record on climate action after Biden condemns Xi’s absence</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The meeting was originally scheduled to last two hours and 45 minutes, but ended up running to five hours, Zou Ji, president of Energy Foundation China, who coordinated the talks between the two countries’ leading experts, was quoted as saying by UK-based website Carbon Brief.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zou said Obama pressed China to commit to peaking carbon emissions “by 2030”, but Xi resisted and would only agree to a timeline of “around 2030”. While Obama finally agreed to the expression of “around 2030”, China added a line: “… and to make best efforts to peak early”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The two countries issued a joint and pivotal statement the next day, declaring their post-2020 climate actions. China announced to peak carbon emissions around 2030 and would strive to peak emissions earlier. The US planned to cut 26 to 28 per cent of emissions from 2005 levels by 2025.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was a high-water mark for China-US cooperation on the environment, observers said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have seen the pinnacle of diplomacy [between the two countries]. For some time in the future, or forever, I don’t think we will exceed that peak,” said Li Shuo, a global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Li said a number of factors came together to make the moment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Air pollution, diplomacy and the economy are three key driving factors of China’s climate and environmental transition,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Floods, fire and pestilence for China as climate change comes home to roost</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China’s high-carbon economic stimulus after the 2008 financial crisis was gradually fading away.
