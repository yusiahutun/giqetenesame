His line of face and body creams have a cult-like following for their ability to make skin look totally rejuvenated. Their collaboration, called the Cell Rejuvenating Priming Moisturizer, is a lightweight but ultra-hydrating cream with a golden, shimmery finish that can be worn alone or under your favorite foundation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's been a dream to develop, with Augustinus, a priming moisturizer that works to improve the health of my skin and gives me that fresh, natural glow that I love," Beckham said in a release. The designer and beauty icon has often commented on how health fats like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a18112/victoria-beckham-skin-secret/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="avocado and salmon" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">avocado and salmon</a> keep her skin plump and glowing, so it's a natural fit that she would develop a moisturizer that mimics that effect.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The moisturizer utilizes Bader's proprietary TFC8 technology to contribute to the skin’s own repair and renewal systems, so it's a primer with anti-aging and skincare benefits. "Infused with powerful actives, the Cell Rejuvenating Priming Moisturizer is clinically tested and shown to help support cell turnover and improve radiance, plump and tone skin, while immediately minimizing the appearance of pores and imperfections," notes the brand.</p><img alt="White, Nose, Ear, Neck, " title="White, Nose, Ear, Neck, " width=1080 height=1350 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cell-rejuvenating-moisturizer-1574107793.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victoria Beckham Beauty</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One pump is enough for your whole face, but the glow it leaves behind is so pretty that you'll want to use two. It instantly brightens skin so that you'll feel like you can use less foundation, and it sinks into skin in seconds. Plus, we love that the formula is clean and it comes housed in a sleek glass tube with minimal plastic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was an honor to collaborate with Victoria for her first skin launch. I am excited to share some of our skincare benefits in this product. It's the first priming moisturizer of its kind to care for your skin cells while also preparing your skin for makeup application," adds Bader.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Victoria Beckham Beauty By Augustinus Bader Cell Rejuvenating Priming Moisturizer will be available on November 1 for $ 95 and $145 at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.victoriabeckhambeauty.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=victoriabeckhambeauty.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">victoriabeckhambeauty.com</a>.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3RnmaaamltgHOFlWtmr6GTqbyztcBmmZ6bm52urnnBnpiurKlirraz1KyroqalqHqjrcOeqWablaG5br7Eo6yvnZ6Wwaq6xmanq6GdnruoecyooKyspae2u7HRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
