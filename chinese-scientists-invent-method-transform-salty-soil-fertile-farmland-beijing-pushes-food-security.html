They took crop stalks measuring about 5cm to 15cm (two to six inches) in length and laid them flat under the soil at a depth of 30cm to 40cm, which prevents the salt from rising to the surface. They also covered the ground with a layer to plastic to help retain soil moisture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After this treatment, the salt content of the soil was reduced by 36 per cent on average and crop yields increased by 30.5 per cent, according to the official Science and Technology Daily on Friday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the report, the team spent more than a decade researching the treatment of saline-alkaline soil in other parts of China, including Shandong and Heilongjiang provinces, and explored soil restoration methods tailored to local conditions.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

hectares (247 million acres) about a third of which has potential for use with soil treatment or better farming practices.</p>The vast majority of this barren land is located in the arid and semi-arid regions of central and western China, including Qinghai province, Inner Mongolia and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span

has embarked on large-scale national campaigns to manage saline and alkaline soil.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the problem in a speech last July: “Given that China has a lot of saline lands and the trend of salinisation of farmland is worsening in some areas, it is of great significance to carry out comprehensive improvement and utilisation.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an interview with state-run China News Service this month, Ma Wei, a scientist at the Jilin Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, noted that China now had more than 40 methods or technologies for treating saline soil.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Many countries are taking action and pioneering many practices and measures to develop and manage affected soils,” Ma said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added that China has provided Belt and Road Initiative countries and developing countries advanced technology and experience to address the problem, but the country was also learning from others and has introduced rice seeds with salt-tolerant genes from Italy, Japan, South Korea, the United States and other countries.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Officials pledged to keep total grain output above 650 million tonnes (717 million tons), a level China has achieved since 2015, as Beijing prioritises self-sufficiency in the face of rising climate shocks and an uncertain global food market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a note to the rural work meeting, Xi described farmland as China’s “lifeblood” and urged increased investment in “high-quality” farmland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), more than 833 million hectares of land around the world were salinised – an area around four times the size of India that represents about 9 per cent of the Earth’s land surface.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the FAO, unsustainable agricultural practices and overexploitation of natural resources, as well as a growing global population, have put growing pressure on soil, causing alarming rates of soil degradation worldwide.</p><p
