He also suggested that the animal could be a 'pre-historic specimen frozen in the permafrost.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>After initially sharing Smith's idea of the creature being a pre-historic specimen, Professor Alex Rogers, Professor of Conservation Biology at Oxford University said he believed the creature was a giant beaked whale.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Speaking to the MailOnline, Professor Rogers said he had seen photos of a dead pilot whale from the Falklands with 'a similar furry appearance to the carcass.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He believed the furry appearance was actually 'very decayed subcutaneous tissue.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'It suggests to me that my second guess of a very decomposed beaked whale is more likely.

Anastasia Steshina, who also made the video, said: "It was caught by my fisherman friend.
