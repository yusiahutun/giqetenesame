The overall theme of the song seems to revolve around the irresistible allure of someone who possesses an ethereal beauty and charm. It explores the idea of falling for someone who may not be the best choice for us, but still, we find ourselves drawn to them.One standout lyric that helps develop the themes of the song is "The way you got that glow, it's like you're reading my mind". This line emphasizes the captivating nature of the person being described. It suggests that this person has a certain aura around them, an energy that can seemingly penetrate the depths of one's thoughts and desires. This theme of being mesmerized by someone's presence establishes the idea that the protagonist is helplessly enticed by the angelic figure they are sleeping with.Another significant lyric is "Lost in thrills, stealing time". This lyric sheds light on the forbidden nature of the relationship the protagonist is involved in. There's a sense of danger and excitement in stealing time away with this angelic being. It hints at the thrill they experience together, even though they may be aware that it's not entirely right. This theme explores the universal human tendency to be drawn to the allure of the forbidden, embracing the intensity of the moment despite the potential consequences.The line that says "I can take you anywhere" showcases an underlying theme of escapism in the song.

This theme delves into the desire to flee from the mundane and ordinary aspects of life in pursuit of something more magical and enchanting. It suggests that the intense connection between them allows for a transcendent experience, promising an escape from the ordinary.Moving on, the lyric "Tonight I'm sleeping with an angel, and if my heart says no, gotta let it go" delves into the conflict of emotions that the protagonist faces.
