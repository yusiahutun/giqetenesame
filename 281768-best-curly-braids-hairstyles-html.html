Detangling helps in elongating and stretching out the curls as far as possible. When the braids have dried up, you can maximize the length and also minimize the shrinkage. Here are the procedural steps afterwards:</p><h4><strong>Step 1: Section the curls</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Pull back all the hair at the back, then with a comb or your hands divide them into sections. A comb is preferred since it really partitions the hair into the different sections. Pick up the section by the ears and divide them into two strand twists. On the other side, repeat the same process with more precision until all the hair has been sectioned. It is advised to twist the hair since it helps in maintaining the moisture as you progress to working on the other sections. This also prevents getting the hair dry and frizzing as you work on the other sections.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs771bqrbohfs.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Step by step guide on how to do bob box braids</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3c6cb62b4d43fb1c.jpg><h4><strong>Step 2: Smoothing of the hair</strong></h4><p class=align-left>With the use of your fingers in the middle section, the hair smooth while combing it at the back. Pick up a small section of the hair line and partition it into three parts and commence with the braiding. It is easy to go for a braid out as compared to going for a French braid. French braids are hard nut to crack since when they are released they give off more of a zigzag pattern when the results should be a curl.</p><p class=align-left>Alternatively, you can utilize the Dutch braiding technique which is the same as used when making cornrows. When you finished off with the style it adds more lift to the scalp as opposed to the French braids which lay flat against the head.</p><h4><strong>Step 3: Braiding</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Braiding is the tricky part when making the curls. You can simply overlap each of the three mini sections that you have created with one section of the hair at a time. If you are going for a Dutch braid or the corn row, ensure that the middle section goes over from the outside sections. Place each of the section of the hair to the middle position at least once; also go for the next cross over as you add more hair to the outside piece.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs7jd1f4jlepo.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Simple braided hairstyles for short natural hair</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, overlap the middle piece over that section as you repeat with the outside piece on the remaining side.
