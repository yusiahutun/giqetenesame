These are areas where your blood vessels are closest to the skin, such as your wrists, behind your ears, at the base of your throat, and even behind your knees. The warmth from these areas helps to intensify the fragrance and make it last longer.”</p><p><strong>Contributor:&nbsp;</strong>Dr. Anna Chacon, Dermatologist - <a href=#>MyPsoriasisTeam</a></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>When it comes to making a statement and standing out in a crowd, nothing does it better than a tantalizing body mist.
