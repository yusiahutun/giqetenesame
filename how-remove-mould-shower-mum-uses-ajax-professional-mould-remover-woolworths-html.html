Then pour vinegar over all the surfaces, to kill all the mould spours. You really don't want to be breathing those in'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Please don't use this on glass. You only need glass cleaner sponge and squeeze to clean any glass. Chemicals like this will cause damage on the glass over time,' another woman suggested.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A third added: 'I would spray again and let it sit then give it a good scrub maybe with gumption then rinse with vinegar or clove oil actually kills mould, spores.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Removing mould from your home should always be handled with care because mould can lead to serious health implications.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>How to remove mould from your home:</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>Professional cleaner Anita Birges recommends first cleaning the area with a homemade solution spray followed by a 'prevention solution'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>1.
