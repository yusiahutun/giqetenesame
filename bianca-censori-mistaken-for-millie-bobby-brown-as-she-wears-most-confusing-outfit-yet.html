So confusing, some were mistaking her for someone else.</strong></p><p>Ever since <a href=#>Kanye West</a> and <a href=#>Bianca Censori</a> got together, his wife has been making headlines for her fashion choices, which many believe are strictly down to Ye. His <a href=#>Instagram</a> has gained tons of attention in that time, as he regularly posts NSFW pics of his wife. Now, the paps do that job for him as lately, it seems like we can’t go one day without seeing a bit too much of Bianca…</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-2033234283-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bianca-censori-steps-out-in-confusing-blue-bodysuit-and-white-tights>Bianca Censori steps out in ‘confusing’ blue bodysuit and white tights</h2><p>The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> were having a normal date night, stepping out to the theatre to watch Dune 2, featuring <a href=#>Zendaya</a> and Timothee Chalamet.</p><p>Although the <a href=#>music</a> star was appropriately dressed for the theatre, with his usual black hoodie and black pants, his wife was not.</p><p>In one of her most ‘mismatched’ outfits yet, the former Yeezy employee stepped out in a low-cut blue body suit which was cut out at the back.</p><p>Instead of wearing a pair of pants or jeans over the bodysuit, Bianca opted for a pair of white tights to wear underneath, rounding the look off with a pair of white heels.</p><p>Her hair was scraped back into a bun, so her top was on full display. The architect looked in good spirits as she could be seen cracking some smiles and laughs as she held her husband’s hand.</p><p>“For a minute I thought that was Millie Brown,” wrote one fan on X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>, in reference to her Stranger Things character, Eleven.</p><p>“Interesting outfit choice for the movies,” penned another.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-covered-up-while-out-with-stepdaughter-north-west>The star ‘covered up’ while out with stepdaughter North West</h2><p>Despite being known for her ‘revealing’ looks, the 29-year-old stepped out covered head to toe with a fur jacket and black leggings while out to dinner with Ye and his eldest daughter, North West.</p><p>Once again, the rapper was dressed in his black hoodie and pants, while North sported a black Raiders jersey.</p><p>It comes after reports suggested Kim Kardashian didn’t want Censori to dress how she normally does, around the kids.</p><p>“Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids. She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that,” a source <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> the Daily Mail.</p><p>However, the two looked on good terms as they ran into each other during Ye’s listening party, and it looks like Bianca even took some <a href=#>fashion</a> advice from Kim as she was spotted <a href=#>wearing a ‘SKIMS dupe’</a> just last week.</p><p>Although some may think Ye’s wife looks ‘unrecognizable’ covered up, it’s not the first time. At the start of the year, she was seen in a <a href=#>huge faux fur coat</a>, covering much more than needed, so much so, you could barely see her eyes.</p><p>One extreme to another!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2eCcK7ImqWcmV2Ysq%2B%2FzqugZqWZqMGit8SnZJ%2BnomK6qrjLopxmmp%2BXr7p5waumsKZdlsBuv8eeZLCdkafAbrnOrKtmm5%2Bjs7a%2FyKeeZqelqbOqwIyynK1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
