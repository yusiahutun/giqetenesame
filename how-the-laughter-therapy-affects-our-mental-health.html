All of this is possible with laughter therapy, and it’s not a joke. <strong>Laughter therapy is a sort of treatment that employs humour to help people cope with stress, pain, and chronic conditions. Clowns, comic movies, literature, games, and riddles are all examples of laughter therapy exercises</strong>. These exercises aid in the relief of stress and the management of <a href=#>anxiety</a>, depression, and other <a href=#>serious illnesses</a>. Laughter therapy has a wide range of advantages, from improving mood to activating organs and lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>A yoga expert provided his thoughts on laughter therapy. expressing “A genuine laugh can lower stress hormones like adrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone in the body. Laughter can also boost the number of antibody-producing cells in the body and boost T-cell efficiency. Reduced stress levels and improved immunity are two benefits of genuine laughter. All of these advantages, according to research, can be obtained by a burst of fake/voluntary laughter.”</p><p>“Our bodies can’t tell the difference between fake and real laughter,” he continued. <strong>The crucial thing to remember is that the psychological and physiological effects of both false and real laughter are identical. Laughter has a great influence on our bodies, whether it comes from a volunteer or spontaneously</strong>. Even if we pretend to laugh, it helps to relieve stress and increase immunity, as well as achieve genuine laughter. It’s a case of faking it until you make it.” “It may seem unusual to fake laugh at first, but after the person learns the benefits and grasps the concept, they will deliberately fake laugh and improve their moods,” he continued. “When a person is in a group or receiving group laughter therapy, it will be considerably simpler.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.psychologs.com/laravel-filemanager/photos/3358/la%20the.jpg alt width=1280 height=371 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Laughter therapy, according to the yoga guru, has a slew of other health benefits, including the ability to combat mood swings.
