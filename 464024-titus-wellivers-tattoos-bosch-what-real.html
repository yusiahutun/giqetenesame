Welliver is an American actor best known for his portrayals of the Man in Black in <i>Lost</i>, Silas Adams in <i>Deadwood</i>, Jimmy O'Phelan in <i>Sons of Anarchy</i>, and most iconically, Harry Bosch in <i>Bosch</i>. Given that his tattoos are quite noticeable when he plays the detective, some viewers wonder whether this is intentionally done using fakes for the character's backstory.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1a1191727583ed92.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Drew Starkey's bio: partner, net worth, parents, and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> <i>check out news exactly <strong>for YOU</strong> ➡️ find "Recommended for you" block and enjoy!</i></p><p class=align-left>Are the tattoos real on Bosch's arms?

So did the show decide to pull a Michael Scofield and <a href=#>draw</a> them on, or are they real sleeves? In an interview with the <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tampa Bay Times</a></i> in 2017, the actor revealed that every tattoo he has is real. "The tattoos are real.

Unfortunately, although it is common knowledge that he has over 30 tattoos, not all of them are publicly visible. Therefore, it is impossible to tell the meanings of all his tattoos. However, given that he has not provided a catalogue, here are some of Welliver's tattoos and what they mean.</p><h3>1. Two koi fish circling a rock</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aa51f2c2a15876cb.jpg><p class=align-left>The <i>Bosch </i>actor has an image of two koi fish circling a rock on his shoulder. In his interview with Inked, he revealed that this image was his first tattoo. It is the symbol of his martial arts dojo. The two koi circling a rock represent fluidity.</p><h3>2. The Silver Surfer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1a1191727583ed92.jpg><p class=align-left>If you didn't know before that the actor was a comic book fan, now you do. Right below his first tattoo, Titus has a tattoo of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Silver Surfer </a>from Marvel Comics. The Silver Surfer is a humanoid alien with metallic skin who can travel through space with the aid of his surfboard-like craft.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eafd143f6ba9ce43.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rudy Pankow (JJ Maybank): height, dating, siblings, net worth, TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Apart from the character's back story and his level of fame as a comic book character, the Silver Surfer image makes for an excellent tattoo. It is framed by a flower tattoo to the left and a few words to the right.</p><h3>3. White pony</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b28182d3122bb862.jpg><p class=align-left>On his right arm still, the <a href=#>talented actor</a> has a small depiction of a pony galloping into the distance. Right on top of the horse, the words 'So it goes' are written, followed by an ellipsis. Looking at the actor, you may wonder what such an image might mean to him.</p><p class=align-left>Surprisingly, the actor reveals that the tattoo is a tribute to his favourite band. He reveals on Spin that his ink was inspired by the cover of the Deftones' White Pony album.</p><h3>4. The wildcats</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8e097a68032fb20d.png><p class=align-left>Numerous <a href=#>tattoo designs</a> cover Welliver's sleeves. On his right forearm, he has a tattoo of three wildcats, top to bottom. The first one from the top is a lion's head, the second one is a tiger's face, and the third one is the face of a bobcat. The actor later covered the lion's head with a tattoo of a rose flower.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f7cca8f29d32258c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Madelyn Cline's bio: sexuality, dating, net worth, height, family</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although he hasn't revealed what they mean, many people use lion and tiger tattoos to convey the wearer's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bravery and courage</a>.</p><h3>5. Weapons</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d1a01a67ae245ba7.png><p class=align-left>To the left of the three wildcat heads, he has a tattoo of a closed fist, followed by a stick, a revolver, and a knife. Welliver has not yet publicly revealed the meaning of these tattoos. But, the two most common meanings people associate with their gun tattoos are strength and power.</p><h3>6. Bear and Wolf</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/eafd143f6ba9ce43.jpg><p class=align-left>On the inside of his forearm is another tattoo of the face of a bear and the letters NTBFW. Right next to them is a wolf tattoo on the inside of his right wrist with the words Lone Wolf written above them.</p><p class=align-left>The three tattoos have different meanings, although they are slightly related. The bear tattoo represents courage and endurance. The letters, initials for the slang "Not To Be F*cked With", have a self-explanatory meaning. The wolf represents the loyalty and love he has for his pack.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/50000dcff8880001.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gabrielle's bio: husband, family, awards, and eye problem</span></p></a><h3>7.
