They simply receive Bluetooth signals from your phone or other device and output it in a wired format that you can plug into your favorite <a href=#>headphones</a>, <a href=#>speakers</a>, or <a href=#>stereo system</a>.</p><p>The most important factor to consider when buying a Bluetooth audio receiver is the connectivity, both Bluetooth and wired. For example, on the wireless side, a more basic receiver might only offer the standard SBC Bluetooth codec, while more advanced models might offer the <a href=#>aptX codec as well</a>. You also need to consider that older models may not support more recent Bluetooth versions, which means they’ll lack features in comparison.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The wired connectivity is just as critical. For example, using a receiver that only has a pair of <a href=#>RCA analog audio outputs</a> won’t do much good if you’re trying to plug in headphones. Most receivers come with at least a pair of RCA audio outputs and often a 3.5mm auxiliary jack or headphone output. Pricier models may also add digital audio outputs.</p><p>You also need to consider where you will use the receiver most frequently. A small 3.5mm dongle may work fine in the car for a few hours, but you're out of luck if the battery runs out. A dedicated Bluetooth car kit is better than something more general if you're mainly listening in the car.</p><p>Finally, there’s the question of budget. While we’ve made multiple picks that are quite affordable, spending more on a receiver with higher-grade components can make for a noticeable difference in audio quality. You’ll need to balance performance and price when choosing which receiver to buy.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><td colspan=3 style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p><strong>How Did We Research</strong></p></td></tr><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Models Evaluated</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Hours Researched</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>Reviews Analyzed</p></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>13</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>4</p></td><td style=text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom><p>19</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>How-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

Even better, aptX-HD bumps the bitrate up to 24-bit, making for much better sound.</p><p>Sound quality depends more on the speakers or headphones you’re listening on, but the built-in AKM4396 USB DAC chip delivers high-quality audio to your hardware.
