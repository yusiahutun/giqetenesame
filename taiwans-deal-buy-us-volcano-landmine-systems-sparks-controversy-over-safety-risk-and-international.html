This has hampered the development of Kinmen for a long time,” she noted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">KMT legislator Lai Shyh-bao said the government and military should tell the public if the long-time strategy of keeping decisive battles outside Taiwan is still in place.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The deployment of the system means we would allow the battle to take place within our territory.

Some of the systems have already been sent to Ukraine to help counter the Russian invasion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wang Ting-yu, a legislator from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said the anti-tank mines were designed to explode only when run over by heavy vehicles so people would not be injured by accidentally stepping on one.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[A mine] can easily be identified with the naked eye as it it is laid on the surface instead of being placed underground. Also, it self-destructs when left for longer than the preset time,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wang also said that the system would only be deployed if the People’s Liberation Army sends an amphibious force to land in Taiwan and it will not be used in peace time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DPP legislator Chao Tien-lin said the system could help Taiwan bolster its asymmetric capability, which would help deter attacks.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Taiwan to test main airport defence for first time in Han Kuang exercises</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Certain people are exaggerating the risks – apparently to pander to China, which does not want Taiwan to deploy the system as it could create difficulty for it in the event of an amphibious attack on Taiwan,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Su Tzu-yun, a senior analyst at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, said the system would help resist or deter an amphibious landing by the PLA.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As the mines can be seen with the naked eye and the PLA forces would need time to clear them or avoid the mined area by going in another direction, it would give our forces much need-needed time to concentrate their fire on them,” Su said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyutcuiq5qqqWSus8DInKOeZ2Nnf3eAkmpmrZmZrK6vv4ydnJqkXZfCunnUrGSvp5yYrq%2B7jKWYp5ydnrumedKyqq2dnah6tLzAq6KsZZOku7W%2Bzq%2Bcq6upYry3sdFmqpqelanGbr7IrKJmmZ6Zeqq6056pp5mknryvrcs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
