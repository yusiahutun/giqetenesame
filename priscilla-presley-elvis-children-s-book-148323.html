She had her nine-year-old twin granddaughters, Harper and Finley (their parents are <a href=#>Lisa Marie Presley</a> and Michael Lockwood), in mind as she penned the sweet <a href=#>children's book</a>, adapted from her <a href=#>ex-husband Elvis</a>’ ballad.</p><p>“The twins know [all] about their grandfather,” says Priscilla, 72. “His love of Graceland, his movies, and his songs. They can hear one of his songs and know right away that’s his voice.”</p><p>It's beautiful that Priscilla is determined to keep the singer's memory alive not just for his fans, but for her family as well. While the twins know about their grandfather, it is her hope that the book will resonate with them on a deeper level.</p><p>“I can’t imagine them not liking the book. First of all, they will instantly recognize the title and secondly, it’s a feel-good story of love and accepting and a happy ending. Isn’t that what children want?” she added. "Both Harper and Finley enjoy going to bookstores and picking out books. They love fairy tales. When they started to read it was more them wanting to read to me. They like doing things for themselves and sharing the stories."</p><p>The song of the same title that the book is based on was originally recorded by Elvis in 1956 and became a staple of great American music. She explained that the book is "a heartwarming ode to the special bond between children and adults who love and care for them. My hope is that kids will play the record and identify with Elvis."</p><p>And when it came to inspiration, she also gave credit to her granddaughters. “I’ve learned to really listen to what [the girls are] saying,” she added. “They have so much to contribute in their opinions, their viewpoints and questions. I value that very much.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46pqaKrk565ra2Mqameq5yaxm6xy6%2BgrGWTnbatsNGepWarXZe8sLeMamtxa2JofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
