Some of them are common, but for others, you've probably wondered what a particular symbol means more than once.</p><p>Thankfully, the internet has many symbol identifier resources to help. We'll show you how to find out a symbol's meaning using a variety of methods.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=identify-symbols-using-symbols-com>1. Identify Symbols Using Symbols.com</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Symbols-Com-Search.png><p>The aptly named <a href=#>Symbols.com</a> is a great place to start your search. Along with featured picks and categories on the homepage, you can use its symbol search engine to find what you're looking for. Just type in a query at the top, and you'll see symbols that match it.</p><p>That's great if you want to find a symbol by text (for example, looking up the symbol for "kosher"). But in many cases, you'll see a symbol and wonder what its meaning is. Thankfully, the site offers other ways to identify a symbol.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>At the bottom-left of the page, you'll see the <strong>Graphical Index</strong> section. This allows you to search for a symbol based on its characteristics. It provides a few simple dropdown boxes allowing you to specify whether the shape is open or closed, if it has colors, whether the lines are curved or straight, and similar.</p><p>Input as much information as you know, then click <strong>Search</strong> to look up symbols that match your criteria. If this doesn't help you find what you're looking for, you can use the <strong>Symbol categories</strong> to browse by groupings like <strong>Currency signs</strong>, <strong>Warning symbols</strong>, and others.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If that fails, you can search alphabetically using the letters at the top of the screen. If you're not looking for anything in particular, the <strong>Random Entry</strong> link can help you learn something new.</p><p>This website is part of a network called STANDS4 that helps you look up lots of other information. See the links at the bottom to visit similar sites for finding info on ZIP codes, common phrases, rhymes, and more.</p><h2 id=draw-a-symbol-to-find-out-its-meaning>2. Draw a Symbol to Find Out Its Meaning</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Draw-Symbol-Shapecatcher.png><p>If you're puzzled by a symbol you saw offline, it makes more sense to find the symbol by a picture. You'll find several sites that offer the functionality to draw a symbol and find out what it means.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>One of these is <a href=#>Shapecatcher</a>. Simply draw the symbol you want to look up using your mouse or touchscreen and click the <strong>Recognize</strong> button. The service will return symbols that match your drawing.</p><p>If you don't see a match, draw it again and give it another try. The site only uses free Unicode fonts, so it might not have every possible symbol. For an alternative, try <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Detexify</a>. It's focused on LaTeX symbols, but is still generally useful and will point you in the right direction of the symbol.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=search-symbols-with-google>3. Search Symbols With Google</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Google-Symbol-Search.png><p>If you come across an unfamiliar icon while you're browsing the web, you don't have to worry about looking it up on a symbol identifier site. Simply run a symbol search with Google, and you should have your answer within seconds.</p><p>In Chrome, along with most other browsers, you can easily search Google for any text. Simply highlight it on the page, right-click, and choose <strong>Search Google for "[term]"</strong>. This will open a new tab with a Google search for what you highlighted. If your browser doesn't have this for some reason, you can simply copy the symbol like you would any other text and paste it into Google on a new tab.</p><p>Either way, Google should point you in the right direction to find the meaning of that symbol. You'll be able to learn all about it on resources like Wikipedia.</p><h2 id=browse-a-list-of-symbols>4. Browse a List of Symbols</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Compart-Unicode-Symbol-List.png><p>Unicode (the standard for text encoding) supports a number of common symbols, which is how they can appear like standard text. While they don't have dedicated keys on a standard keyboard, you can <a href=#>use several methods to type foreign characters</a> instead.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If you couldn't find the symbol you're looking for using any of the above methods, you might be able to find it by browsing through all the symbols that Unicode supports. Have a look at <a href=#>Compart's list of "other symbol" Unicode characters</a> and you might find the one you're interested in. If you prefer an alternative, check out the <a href=#>Unicode Character Table</a>.</p><p>Of course, not all symbols are supported in Unicode. Road signs, religious symbols, and everyday consumer symbols aren't part of it. You may need to dig into <a href=#>Wikipedia's list of symbols page</a> for those kinds of icons, or see <a href=#>Ancient-Symbols's list of symbols</a> for less techy ones.</p><h2 id=learn-what-emoji-symbols-mean>5.
