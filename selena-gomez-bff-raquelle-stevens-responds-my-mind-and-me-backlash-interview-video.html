The author sat down for an interview on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chicks in the Office</a> podcast, and admitted she knew she’d be judged for appearing in such a popular and public film. “Anytime you do anything public in life, you’re subject to opinions of other people,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“You just don’t even go there if you’re not willing to be able to take the heat, but, you know, the biggest thing for me was that the documentary was a beautiful, beautiful piece of work that Selena so vulnerably shared with the world,” she continued<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" aria-describedby=audioeye_new_window_message data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>.</a>&nbsp;“It was her life story, and part of what was included in that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>documentary</a> was our friendship, which is special and it’s honest, and it’s real.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Selena-Gomez-Raquelle-Stevens-backgrid-embe.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The backlash Raquelle received resulted in a scene that showed her asking Selena, who she’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been friends</a> with for years, why she didn’t want to go to a friend’s birthday party after they got home from a trip. Their discussion escalated when she told the “Wolves” crooner that she didn’t seem “happy.” Selena then left the room after denying she was “complaining” about work.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I think what it’s a good reminder of is that when people are scrolling through Instagram or they’re scrolling through TikTok, or you’re watching a documentary, you’re getting a small glimpse into someone’s life, you’re not seeing the full picture,” Raquelle also said in her podcast interview. “And the truth is we’ve had a friendship for the last decade because it’s real, it’s honest and I’m so grateful for that. And I’m grateful that it was included in the documentary because I think that it is important to see, and I think it’s amazing that Selena welcomes honesty <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in her friendships</a> and I welcome that in my life too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Selena-Gomez-Raquelle-Stevens-spl-embe.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“That’s the other thing too. And I think this is important for people as well when we talk about, you know, doing the 100 day journey [through the book] and strengthening your inner life,” she added. “When your inner life is strong and you are living a life with integrity, you sleep peacefully every single night. And it doesn’t matter what you face, what you go through — there’s a peace that comes with living a life of integrity, and so I really am secure in who I am. I know the kind of friend that I am. Anyone really could say anything, but I have a peace that is unshakable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze49vZqydnJq7onnGqKSesl2Xs6d50Zqorp2cobJuv9OerZ6mo2K%2Fpr%2FPqKWdq12ixm65yKebZpmemXqusYybmJyjnJbAqXnIp6ueqqaesrh51aKbnqdf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
