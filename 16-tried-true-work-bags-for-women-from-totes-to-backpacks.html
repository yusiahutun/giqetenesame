The Business Bag is the perfect intersection of workwear and style with its sleek art-deco style and monochromatic gradient coloring. While it <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">doesn’t hold a lot</a>, what more should you be bringing to the office other than your laptop, a few papers, and a notebook or two?</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11442100.png><p>If you are looking for versatile and long-lasting, this 3-Way Expandable Briefcase is your bag. It can be worn three ways: as a backpack, on your shoulder, or as a briefcase. However you carry it, it fits loads of stuff with the many pockets and compartments as well as 5 extra liters of expandable space. According to Mystery Ranch’s site, these bags are “built for the mission” and are even beloved by soldiers for their durability.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11442194.png><p>For those of you who need your laptop, a water bottle, a snack, and some miscellaneous bobs and bits, this is the perfect tote for you. Baggu’s Duck Bag is a cool-casual canvas tote that has a deep main compartment for any sized laptop with a built-in zippered bag for all the small things. We love this pastel blue gingham that can easily go from the office to happy hour (or even a date!). The Duck Bag comes in 10 other fun colors/patterns as well as in a horizontal format.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11442215.png><p>Personally, I love a classic tote, and nothing is more classic than Longchamp’s Le Pliage. From the silhouette to the material to the colors, it’s a chef’s kiss that still packs a punch. Whether you’re a soccer mom in the making or just a carrier of snacks and papers, this bag is a stylish, refined solution.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11442074.png><p>This <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Australian brand</a> has once again done it with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">great personal item</a>, but instead of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="backpack (opens in a new tab)" href=#>backpack</a>, it’s the Tokyo Tote, which is made of durable, water-resistant recycled fabric with enough compartments to make your head spin. The organization, the space, and the pockets make sure that at the office you will be equipped with (and able to find) everything that you need from your laptop to hand sanitizer. Thank you <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=#>Bellroy</a> and thank you Australia.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11438371.png><p>While this backpack from Dagne Dover is technically a diaper bag, it still has all the makings of a great work bag with pockets and compartments for space galore. Not only does it boast a velcro laptop pocket, multiple in-bag pockets, and a bottle holder (for adults and children alike), but it also includes a shoe bag, dust bag, and little pouches, too. Talk about being ready for anything!</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11397858.png><p>You may know Shay Mitchell’s brand for its luggage, but it also makes work-appropriate bags. This tote makes a statement while still being suitable for everyday activities. It’s meant to be worn from work to cocktails without looking out of place, and its removable strap helps achieve that. And never straying too far from travel, Béis added a luggage sleeve to make working on the go easier.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11397848.png><p>This Quince tote bag for work is the perfect blend of spaciousness and sophistication. There are plenty of inner and outer pockets as well as a laptop sleeve for all your essentials. It’s also an eco-friendly option since the nylon was made from recycled water bottles, and the trim on the handles and bottom were made from recycled leather.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11397830.png><p>This all-in-one work bag is truly versatile, thanks to what Samsonite calls its “desk-to-dinner silhouette.” The durable leather bag has a detachable and adjustable strap that can be worn as a crossbody, shoulder bag, or briefcase. Plus, there’s plenty of storage inside, including a laptop sleeve and accessory pockets. Chic, elevated, and functional.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11397839.png><p>This large vegan tote bag is a best seller on Dagne Dover’s site, and for good reason. It’s refined on the outside, but wow, there’s a lot going on inside. The bag features pockets in varying sizes, allowing you to separate your lipsticks and pens from your laptop and notebooks while keeping your water bottle upright. Go for the Classic size for 13-inch laptops or the Legend for 15-inch laptops.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11397853.png><p>If you’re looking for a more casual work bag, this puffy tote bag is a fun option. Whether you’re bringing it to the office or taking care of business while traveling, this lightweight bag has multiple pockets, a padded laptop sleeve, and a luggage sleeve. But the most unique part is its expandable bottom, which gives you extra space when you need it and less when you don’t.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11441947.png><p>For those who commute via public transportation, a work backpack may be the most suitable option. This sleek Lululemon backpack offers plenty of room and organization on the inside and a handy water bottle holder on the outside. And when you get caught in the rain, don’t fret because this backpack’s nylon fabric is water-repellent.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i1.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11397843.png><p>To channel the true boss that you are, a luxurious leather tote bag is a pretty good route to go. This medium-size tote is a new arrival for Everlane, and it’s the perfect size to carry all your work staples. Not too big, not too small. And while this work bag may look very minimal and no frills, it still features slip pockets and a snap button to help keep your belongings secure.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i1.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11397846.png><p>Back-to-work backpacks — this one may be a splurge, but it’s worth it, thanks to its super-roomy interior with multiple pockets, a detachable pouch, and a quilted exterior with leather details. This lightweight backpack made from recycled water bottles is perfect for the office (there’s a backpack sleeve) and the airplane (there’s a luggage sleeve, too).</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11397842.png><p>If you like yourself some work-bag accessories, consider going for this versatile two-in-one tote bag. It comes with a separate laptop sleeve in your choice of a matching or contrasting color, depending on how playful you want to be, and a detachable striped crossbody strap for extra comfort. Plus, the bag can be monogrammed (with a $12.50 fee) for a personalized touch.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i1.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11397834.png><p>If you want a retro-looking women’s work bag, an intricate leather briefcase is the way to go. This large briefcase will no doubt fit all of your work/life essentials, and its durable fabric and details, like metal feet, will last you. Wear it as a top-handle or crossbody bag, and take on the day.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><p>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.
