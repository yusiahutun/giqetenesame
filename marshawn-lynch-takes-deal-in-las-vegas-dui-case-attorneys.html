Lynch can now avoid jail time if he fulfills a judge’s requirements.</p><p>Lynch was originally charged with misdemeanor DUI after Las Vegas Metro police said they found him sleeping at the wheel of a car in 2022.</p><p>Ahead of the trial, which was scheduled to start Wednesday, Lynch accepted a plea deal for the misdemeanor DUI. As part of the deal, the charge will be lowered to reckless driving if Lynch completes DUI school, a victim impact panel, an alcohol evaluation, 200 hours of community service, and stays out of trouble for a year, documents said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.8newsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2022/08/My-Post-Copy-1-17.png><p>The case would then be dismissed and closed as a reckless driving infraction, according to the court docs.</p><p>The judge also ordered Lynch to pay a $1,140 fine.</p><p>“Mr. Lynch has not been convicted of any offense at his time,” his attorneys, Richard Schonfeld and David Chesnoff, said in a statement. “He has agreed to complete certain requirements which will result in this case being closed as a reckless driving traffic offense.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.8newsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2022/08/cd1b185824b2489ca49c114f2adb3b2f.jpg><p>Prosecutors suspect Lynch, 37,&nbsp;<a href=#>had a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit</a> in the hours after police found him in a car near the Las Vegas Strip in 2022, documents said.</p><p>Officers arrested Lynch around 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 9, after observing him “asleep behind the wheel with the vehicle in an undrivable condition,” Nexstar’s KLAS previously reported. The car, a 2020 Shelby GT500 Coupe, was unregistered, police said.</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>Los Angeles-bound flight diverted to Chicago for ‘security concern’</a><p>Lynch’s lawyers had argued the case did not constitute a DUI. Nevada law, however, states that a person sitting in the driver’s seat of a vehicle is deemed “in physical control” of that vehicle.</p><p>Lynch&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was involved in a previous crash</a>&nbsp;on Feb. 22, 2022, that led to a parking ticket, KLAS first reported. He was driving on Tropicana Avenue near Santoro Drive around 4 a.m. when his Lamborghini Aventador “collided with landscaping and a fence,” police wrote in a report.</p><p>In that case, police cited Lynch for the crash and did not arrest him. Court records show Lynch pleaded nolo contendere — accepting violation but denying guilt — to a charge of stopping, standing, or parking prohibited in specified places, a misdemeanor. A judge ordered him to pay a $750 fine.</p><p>Lynch most recently played for the Seattle Seahawks and played for the then-Oakland Raiders for the 2017-2018 season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46nmK2hn6OurXnNnq6sZ52Wv7S0wLClZqSpo7CpedOaop6rXZmyoriMoqVmpJGoerexxpqqZpylnnqkrdKeZJqspKS%2Fr7HYrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
