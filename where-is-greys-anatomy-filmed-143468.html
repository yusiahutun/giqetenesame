Find out Here!</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>If there’s one city <a href=#>Grey’s Anatomy</a> is associated with, it’s obviously Seattle since that’s where the show is set. But, believe it or not, most scenes aren’t actually shot in the rainy Pacific Northwest. They’re actually shot in… sunny Southern California. Bummer.</p><p>When <a href=#>the Grey’s cast started shooting season 14</a> in July, fans were delighted to see that the stars were actually in Seattle. <a href=#>Jesse Williams</a> (who plays Dr. Jackson Avery) posted a pic to Instagram at the start of the cast and crew’s season with the Seattle Great Wheel at Pier 57 in the background. He was hanging with <a href=#>Ellen Pompeo</a> (Dr. Meredith Grey) and <a href=#>Justin Chambers</a> (Dr. Alex Karev) and <a href=#>captioned the photo</a>, “#Squad #Work #Eat #Play #Live #Seattle life ain’t stale.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/greys-anatomy-filmed.jpg><p>(Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><p>But that small bit of Seattle authenticity aside, the Grey’s cast can typically be found in LA. Most scenes of the show are taped at Prospect Studios in Los Feliz, which is just east of Hollywood. It’s there that the Grey’s Anatomy set occupies six massive sound stages primarily used for interior scenes including any operating rooms, hospital hallways, and the reception area. Fun fact: General Hospital is also shot at Prospect Studios as well!</p><p>Some of the <a href=#>scenes set at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital</a> are filmed at the Veterans Administration Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center, which is a real-life medical facility located at 16111 Plummer Street in North Hills (north-central San Fernando Valley). One side of the building is used for establishing shots of the hospital, while another is used as a location for the characters to exit and congregate, but again, most of the scenes are shot in Los Feliz.</p><p>Keeping things (a little) real though, are some of the outside scenes, which are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Also, Meredith’s house (aka the Intern House) is actually located at 303 W. Comstock Street in Seattle’s Queen Anne neighborhood, and the hospital’s rooftop helipad sits on top of KOMO Plaza, which is just north of Seattle’s downtown. So it isn’t all lies! Whether Grey’s Anatomy is actually filmed in Seattle or LA makes no difference to us, as long as the show continues to be in our lives, all is right with the world.</p><p>Join our <a href=#>Facebook group</a> for the latest news and updates on Grey’s Anatomy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn56qlWK2tHnGq5yyq12Wu6LAzqawZp6ZobqmsIxqa2xsZm18</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
