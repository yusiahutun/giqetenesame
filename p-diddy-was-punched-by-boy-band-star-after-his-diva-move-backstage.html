The <a href=#>music</a> star claimed he had a heated head-to-head with Sean Diddy Combs at an after-show party. It’s believed the spat between Boyzone’s Shane Lynch and Diddy took place during the 1999 <a href=#>MTV European Music Awards show</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-singer-claims-they-punched-p-diddy-at-the-mtv-awards-backstage>Singer claims they ‘punched’ P Diddy at the MTV Awards backstage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-459581382-1024x683.jpg><p>During the 2018 Celebrity Big Brother series, Shane was involved in a challenge to prove he could successfully tell a lie. They had to either divulge a real story, or something made up to see if his housemates could work it out.</p><p>Shane chose to tell the story where he reportedly had a fight with P Diddy at the <a href=#>MTV Awards</a> in Dublin.</p><p>He said the duo got into an argument after they began talking about how they wanted to drive a Ferrari. <a href=#>Celebrity</a> conversations, eh? But they had a run-in when Shane claimed Diddy pushed into him when he went to the bathroom.</p><p>Then he explains, P Diddy pulled a real diva move at the MTV Awards that would make Mariah Carey proud.</p><p>He said: “It was the MTV music awards. I was drunk. We were In the green room. His entourage said he wanted it for himself, and I wasn’t having any of that. So I went to rob him of his silver chain, and it was more a scuffle.'”</p><p>The story he told was true, to Shane’s account, as part of the challenge.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-saw-red>‘I saw red’</h2><p>In 2000, the singer also told The Mirror that the row broke out. Shane said at the time, he attempted to return to the VIP area he and his friends and family were in after using the restroom. But when he returned, his entourage ordered everyone out, so P Diddy could have the MTV Awards VIP room to himself.</p><p>He claims his wife at the time, Easther Bennett, was ‘pushed’ by a bodyguard and he ‘saw red’.</p><p>Then Diddy – according to the boyband member – was pouring champagne towards him, which angered him even more. So, he threw a punch.</p><p>Shane added: “Nobody would sort it out, so I went through them to get down the stairs. Puff Daddy was standing on a table holding a bottle of champagne. He pointed it and started to shoot it at me for whatever reason, I don’t know.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“So I jumped through the air and gave him a solid one to the jaw and he fell off the table. Then all hell broke loose. His security men and bouncers headed for me wondering, “Who is this lunatic?”‘</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-p-diddy-came-forward-after-his-diva-move-at-the-mtv-awards>P Diddy came forward after his ‘diva move’ at the MTV Awards</h2><p>But in 2014, Shane said P Diddy reached out after the ruckus.</p><p>He said a “week or so later” the rapper sent Shane flowers and apologies, so they could move on past the ordeal.</p><p>However, the backstage drama wasn’t the only thing that ruffled feathers.</p><p>When Boyzone were picking up the gong for Best Album, Shane, who had a bit to drink, unleashed an f-word filled rant on stage.</p><p>Shane had a few pints to calm his nerves, and didn’t realize how laid back he was at the event. They later apologized to MTV in 2008.</p><p>The group said: “We’d like to take this opportunity to apologize to the channel. As a band we are really keen to bury the hatchet.&nbsp;</p><p>“Back in those days, Shane thought if we went prepared we wouldn’t win anything. He’d had more than a few pints to calm his nerves.&nbsp;</p><p>They added: “Because he was drunk he ended up effing and blinding on stage and later had a fight with P Diddy and proper slapped him on the head. That wasn’t very representative of the band. He didn’t show any respect and is very sorry.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WCcLyMnaCdnKlixKK%2FjKmsp5uYmrFurthmmaixXZeur7CMrKuaql2Ws7Wx0Wafoqtdmba3rYympq%2BdXZeupLfSrZignV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
