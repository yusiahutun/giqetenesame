Not only has he played Master Yoda, but he is responsible for some of <a href=#>Sesame Street and the Muppets’</a> most pivotal characters. For close to 40 years, Oz was the hand that operated Fozzie Bear, Bert, Cookie Monster, Grover, and Miss Piggy.</p><p id=par-2_26>Not only did Oz collaborate alongside Muppet founder Jim Henson, but he also directed some of the most revered comedy <a href=#>films</a> of the last 30 years.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_21>Oz gave an interview in late August 2021 where he broke down why he was no longer working with the Muppets.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=h-since-the-beginning-of-the-muppets-frank-oz-has-been-there>Since the beginning of The Muppets, Frank Oz has been there&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_46>Oz was born in England and moved to California as a child. He met Henson as a teenager while both were employed as puppeteers at an amusement park. For many years, the two worked together on various projects, including The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, and <a href=#>Labyrinth</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_38>His directing credits with the <a href=#>Jim Henson Company</a> include The Dark Crystal and The Muppets Take Manhattan.

Oz told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a> that Disney, who now owns the Muppet characters, was no longer interested in hiring him.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_24>“I’d love to do the Muppets again, but Disney doesn’t want me,” Oz said. He added, “<a href=#>Sesame Street</a> hasn’t asked me for 10 years.”</p><p id=par-8_35>Oz claimed that he and the company differed on the Muppets’ creative direction. “They don’t want me because I won’t follow orders, and I won’t do the kind of Muppets they believe in,” he continued.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>SHOUT OUT to Frank Oz (<a href=#>@TheFrankOzJam</a>) for no particular reason other than his unparalleled artistry, a lifetime of superb work as a director/actor/writer/mensch & for our friendship that has lasted longer than many marriages.

There’s an inability for corporate America to understand the value of something they bought. They never understood, with us, it’s not just about the puppets, it’s about the performers who love each other and have worked together for many years.”</p><h2 id=h-the-former-muppeteer-believes-selling-out-is-what-killed-jim-henson>The former Muppeteer believes selling out is what killed Jim Henson</h2><p id=par-11_18>In one of the interview’s most controversial statements, Oz attributed Henson’s death to the effects of selling out.</p><p id=par-12_14>“The Disney deal is probably what killed Jim,” he claimed. “It made him sick.”</p><p id=par-13_31>In 1989, Henson and Michael Eisner began deliberations to merge the former’s company with Disney.

He was an artist, and it was destroying him, it really was.”Oz reiterated at the end of the interview that he was pushed out of The Muppets organization. However, his iconic characters from Sesame Street and The Muppet Show still hold a special place in his heart.&nbsp; “I miss them and love them,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6trzPnqusZZanrq%2B3jKixZq6fnrCmecyiqqxloJ60qMWMnKOaoZ2oerHB0qGcnWWfqsFurthmm6KrnprGb7TTpqNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
