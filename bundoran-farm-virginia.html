Lately, the retired school principal can look out her window and see dozens of little lambs following their mothers around the pasture. She finds delight in admiring the cute creatures from afar, and relishes the fact that she doesn't have to do any of the work (feeding, shepherding) involved in caring for them. It's moments like these that attracted Mary, 73, and husband William, 75, to their neighborhood in the foothills of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains, a historic farm they share with some 20 other families.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">When the couple retired 10 years ago, they toyed with the idea of buying a farm, but quickly realized they weren't up to the task of actually farming. They looked at old farm land in Vermont, Rhode Island, and western New York, but had trouble finding property that suited their precise needs. "We wanted place where we wouldn't have to worry that someone would put up car park on the edge of our property," says Mary.</p><img alt="Bundoran Farm Virginia cattle" title="Bundoran Farm Virginia cattle" width=3434 height=2782 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/06/1486594030-bundoran-am-fri-bow6912.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Bundoran Farm</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">When their search led them to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.facebook.com/Qroe-Farm-Preservation-Development-176001657567/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Qroe Farm Preservation" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Qroe Farm Preservation</a> in Swampscott, Massachusetts, they knew they wanted to see more developments like it: neighborhoods where each homeowner's land has an easement and a central farm is leased to a tenant farmer.

Then, depending on the day and time of year, she might head out to her greenhouse to tend to her seedlings, or check on her vegetable garden. She might spend her afternoon volunteering with Virginia Master Naturalists, an organization dedicated to helping conserve the state's public lands, or serving with the farm's board of directors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"The farm is very important to me. We could screw it up if we're not careful so I feel an obligation to get involved with what's happening," she says of her role on the board.</p><img alt="Mountainous landforms, Human body, Cap, Jacket, Tourism, Mountain, Travel, Mountain range, Ice, Formation, " title="Mountainous landforms, Human body, Cap, Jacket, Tourism, Mountain, Travel, Mountain range, Ice, Formation, " width=592 height=640 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/06/1486593946-mary-and-william-tillman.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Mary Tillman</span><p>William and Mary Tillman on a 2016 trip to Patagonia.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The Tillmans have moved around a lot over the years, bouncing from Alexandria, Virginia, to Providence, Rhode Island, and cities in between, thanks to William's job with U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Services, so relocating from New Jersey to the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains was a relatively easy transition. It also coincided with the closing of their respective careers. "Retirement is an art," says Mary. "There are people who sit around but I could never stand that. I had to find things that I like doing and that have meaning."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Unlike the much <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/home-design/g3341/farm-to-table-agrihoods/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="buzzed-about agrihoods" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">buzzed-about agrihoods</a> trending in residential real-estate these days, Bundoran Farm has an authentic agricultural past. The 2,300-acre property is one of the longest continuously operated farms in the state, with 10 acres of wine vineyards, 1,000 acres of protected forest, and 26,000 apple trees dating back to the 1800s. It served as a cattle ranch for more than a century. In fact, the family that sold the homestead to the original developer, Qroe, in 2006 had raised Hereford cattle there since the 1940s.</p><img alt="Mountainous landforms, Farm, Pasture, Highland, Landscape, Plain, Land lot, Hill, Grassland, Field, " title="Mountainous landforms, Farm, Pasture, Highland, Landscape, Plain, Land lot, Hill, Grassland, Field, " width=2000 height=1331 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/06/1486594358-bundoran-am-fri.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Bundoran Farm</span><p>Sunrise over Bundoran Farm.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"There are other developments that have an interpretation of thisâ€”they essentially set aside 50 acres for a common area, token cattle, and a garden," says Hunter McCardle, senior vice president of resort development for Natural Retreats, the developer behind Bundoran. "But that's not a true model of a farm. Nobody can make a dollar on 50 acres of cattle. We have 188 heads of cattle. We allow local farmers to continue to farm [here], whereas if we'd chopped the land up into a bunch of lots for little red rooftops those farmers would have to move. It's harder now for farmers to find land because everything's being developed."</p><img alt="Natural landscape, Grazing, Pasture, Grassland, Plant community, Field, Landscape, Rural area, Plain, Farm, " title="Natural landscape, Grazing, Pasture, Grassland, Plant community, Field, Landscape, Rural area, Plain, Farm, " width=652 height=445 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/06/1486594474-bundoran-farm-cows-grazing.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Bundoran Farm</span><p>Cows grazing in Bundoran\'s easement-protected pasture.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Natural Retreats, founded by former rugby player and Coca-Cola executive Matt Spence, which also owns and operates similar properties near national parks throughout the U.K., bought Bundoran Farm in 2013. At that point, a collapse in the real-estate market and the tragic death of the first developersâ€”Robert Baldwin and David Brown, who died with their plane crash-landed on the property during foggy conditionsâ€”had already threated the longevity of the concept neighborhood. Critics called it a failure. "We bought it because we believed in it. We actually bought it out of frustration and we scrapped hard with Wells Fargo to do it," Spence <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.c-ville.com/bundoran-farm-and-natural-retreats/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told the publication C-ville" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">told the publication C-ville</a> in 2014, also revealing plans to build a home for his own family there.</p><img alt="Bundoran Farm summer picnic" title="Bundoran Farm summer picnic" width=646 height=429 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/06/1486594539-bundoran-farm-family.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Bundoran Farm</span><p>A resident family picnicking on the neighborhood\'s common acreage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The goal was always to "marry development with the conservation of the ecological components and cultural heritage of the land," says McCardle. When the homestead transferred to developers, county officials approved the charter because it focused on land preservation and getting by with as few houses as possible. Two hundred homes could fit there, but lots were limited to 99, McCardle explains. Currently, there are just 20 inhabited houses on the farm, eight under construction, and another 21 lots for sale.</p><img alt="Bundoran Farm trails" title="Bundoran Farm trails" width=643 height=427 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/06/1486594878-bundoran-farm-family-riding-bike.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Bundoran Farm</span><p>The farm includes 15 miles of hiking and biking trails.</p><img alt="Horse, Sorrel, Terrestrial animal, Working animal, Snout, Liver, Mane, Stallion, Stable, Mustang horse, " title="Horse, Sorrel, Terrestrial animal, Working animal, Snout, Liver, Mane, Stallion, Stable, Mustang horse, " width=642 height=424 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/06/1486594670-bundoran-farm-horses.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Bundoran Farm</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The community's design intentionally places lots at the edges of wooded areas, so that houses are not, as Mary Tillman says, "plopped down in middle of pasture." That leaves the pasture land unobstructed and open to being farmed, which also ensures plenty of space (and privacy) between neighbors. Each homeowner's landâ€”lots range from two to 90 acresâ€”is protected by two easements: one for agricultural land and one for forested land. There are tax benefits for the arrangement, and more visible perks, like having cattle and sheep just beyond your front door. (The easements allow tenant farmers to their animals on individuals' property.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">"One of the things that's really kind of cool about this place is that the developer has encouraged the community to become involved in what happens with the farm," says Mary. "We're involved in running the farm, in creating the budget, because ultimately the farm is going to pass into the hands of the people who live here, the community association, instead of having a developer determine everything."</p><img alt="Bundoran Farm stream" title="Bundoran Farm stream" width=1280 height=854 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/06/1486594112-bundoran-farm-000.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Bundoran Farm</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">A recent community project involved putting up a fence to keep the cattle out of the stream. While the neighborhood loves the authentic farm feeling that roaming cows provide, it's also dedicated to doing the right thing environmentallyâ€”not using poisonous insecticides and so onâ€”and cattle in the stream poses a problem. "Our stream runs into other streams and eventually the Chesapeake Bay," says Mary, explaining Bundoran's cattle emptying their waste in the water is problematic. "It seems far from here but we are part of the watershed. It's cumulative and we're dedicated to preserving stream so that it makes a contribution to pure water down the road."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The community's commitment to environmentally sound practices is evident in the homeowners' compliance with the development's strict green building rules as well. All plans for new construction are approved by a design review committee that ensures homes are energy efficientâ€”a process that protects both the homeowners' investments and the environment in the long run. The Tillmans had previously lived in Coral Gables, Florida, a neighborhood that enforced guidelines around house color, fencing, and front yard fixtures, so they didn't find Bundoran's building regulations an imposition. The one part they found challenging was finding outdoor light fixtures that met <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://darksky.org/fsa/fsa-products/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dark Sky standards" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Dark Sky standards</a>, but Mary believes it was worth it. "When you come out to Bundoran at night you can hardly see your hand in front of your face," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">As for her future and present neighbors, she knows they wouldn't put their own homes through the scrutiny of the community's meticulous environmental standards if it weren't important to them. She's noticed that many of her fellow homeowners, who are mostly retirement age with some people in their late 40s to early 50s sprinkled in, are bright minds who've been happy in their work lives. When you serve on a neighborhood committee with them, she says, you get an incredible amount of expertise.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">After living at Bundoran Farm for eight years, Mary is still enchanted by the view. "When I get up every morning and walk out onto my front porch, I look over this beautiful preserved land," she says. "It's a gift."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Follow Country Living on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pinterest.com/countryliving/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=P class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">P</a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pinterest.com/countryliving/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=interest class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">interest</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfp7KiuIyeqq2ZpJp8ooCQb29vZ5Kqu6W70ZqlZp6Rp7puwsirnqKmmZZ8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
