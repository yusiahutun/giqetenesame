Let's Meet the Singer's Four Kids</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Although she is a mother of four, Tina Turner’s children are hardly spotted with their mother. Nevertheless, here is everything you should know about them.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Tina Turner is a name that most might hear nowadays and not recognize. However, you wouldn’t be blamed because she is hardly in the limelight nowadays and has recently retired.&nbsp;</p><p>However, those who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s will tell you the name belongs to a legend. Tina, the ‘Queen of Rock n’ Roll,’ dominated the 1970s with her music.&nbsp;Her songs like “What’s Love Got To Do With It” and “Proud Mary” has become industry classics and are now used as case studies for upcoming musicians.&nbsp;</p><p>In a career <a href=#>spanning </a>over 60 years, Tina has sold over 200 million records worldwide. She has also won 12 Grammy Awards, including three Hall of Fame and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-24.png><p>Away from her musical career, the iconic singer has also been married twice. Tina made her debut performing with her first husband, Ike Turner. They were known as the “Ike and Tina Turner Revue” in the 1960s.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after more than a decade of marriage Tina left Ike and <a href=#>accused </a>him of physical abuse years later. Afterward, she started a relationship with German music executive Erwin Bach. Still, the two have remained together for over 20 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Over her two relationships, Tina Turner is a mother to four children. The musician was already a mother before she married Ike and gave birth to another child during their marriage. Tina also adopted Ike’s two kids from his previous relationship. Below we’ll take an in-depth look into the lives of Tina Turner’s four children.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Craig_Raymond_Turner></span><strong>Craig Raymond Turner</strong>&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tina’s eldest child Craig Raymond Turner was <a href=#>born </a>when the musician was 18. At the time, Tina was in a relationship with a man called Raymond Hill, a saxophonist for the “Kings of Rhythm.” They were the backing band for Ike Turner.&nbsp;</p><p>After Tina and Raymond’s relationship fell apart, she started dating Ike, joined his band, and married him. Craig was with his mother throughout her relationship with Ike, and the little boy often saw them fight.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2005, Tina recounted that Craig was an emotional kid during his childhood. Every time he witnessed Tina and Ike arguing, he would look down in sadness. During one of their fights, he knocked on the door to ask if his mother was fine.&nbsp;</p><p>As an adult, Craig became a real estate agent working for Rodeo Realty in Beverly Hills. Sadly, in 2018 at 56, he was found dead at his home in Studio City, California. Craig died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.&nbsp;</p><p>After his death, the musician held a ceremony to scatter her son’s ashes on July 19, 2018. Tina also opened up about her son’s demise. She <a href=#>noted</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“I think Craig was lonely, that’s what I think really got him more than anything else. I have pictures all around of him smiling, and I think I’m sensing that he’s in a good place. I really do.”&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ronnie_Renelle_Turner></span><strong>Ronnie Renelle Turner</strong>&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tina gave birth to her son Ronald “Ronnie” Renelle Turner in October 1960. He is the biological son of Time and Ike Turner. After his birth, the youngster became interested in music like his parents. He had a talent for <a href=#>arranging </a>music and played multiple instruments as a kid.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>After his parents divorced in 1978, Ronnie started playing the bass guitar for his mother’s band and later played for his father. However, despite his musical talents, Ronnie transitioned into acting.&nbsp;</p><p>His movie career started slowly before he got his big break in the 1993 movie “What’s Love Got To Do With It.” The film, based on his mother’s life, gained him a bit of recognition.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, Ronnie has continued appearing in Hollywood movies, mainly acting in part roles. In 1999, he started working as a real estate broker in Los Angeles. Ronnie is also married to his wife, singer Afida Turner.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ike_Turner_Jr></span><strong>Ike Turner Jr.</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ike Turner Jr was born in 1958 to musician Ike Turner and his mother, Lorraine Taylor. However, just a few years later, Ike left Lorraine and started a relationship with Tina.&nbsp;</p><p>At two, Turner Jr started <a href=#>living </a>with his father and Tina, and the latter subsequently adopted him. Growing up with his father and stepmother, Turner Jr attended a local school before he started assisting his parents in the studio.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-21.png><p>Like his father, Turner Jr showcased musical talents and started playing musical instruments as early as he was 13. He also joined his parent’s band working as a sound engineer for Tina.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1987 Turner Jr released an album titled “Hard Labour” before winning a Grammy Award in 2006. He earned the award for producing his father’s “Risin’ With The Blues” album in the Traditional Blue Category.&nbsp;As of 2017, he reunited with one of his father’s old bandmates Randi Love and then toured with her. He also released a single with her titled “Freaky!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Michael_Turner></span><strong>Michael Turner</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Turner is Ike Turner’s younger son from his relationship with Lorraine Taylor. He was born in 1960 and adopted by Tina once she married his father.&nbsp;<br>Out of all of Tina Turner’s children, Michael has <a href=#>kept </a>himself out of the spotlight. However, Tuner Jr once revealed that his younger brother was recuperating in a Southern California clinic. However, the nature of his illness was not disclosed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jJqpnmWknruiedOuqaedoqh6pLTIpZurnZ5iuabA0maknp2kYsGpsYysoKeflad6p7vUq2SkoZSofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
