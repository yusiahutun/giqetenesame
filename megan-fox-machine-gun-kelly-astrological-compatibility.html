There's no doubt the couple is wild for one another, and their astrological compatibility offers plenty of clues about how the two connect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fox has even said that MGK is her "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>twin flame</a>" — aka two halves of the same soul — which has us wondering how much of their zodiac love life is written in the stars and what exactly it's all about. Ahead, we take a deeper look into Fox and MGK's astrological charts to learn more about their steamy romance and where it's headed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for Fox and Kelly's star signs and what they reveal about their relationship.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-they-share-taurus-sun-signs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>They Share Taurus Sun Signs</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Fox (born on May 16, 1986, at 12:35 a.m. in Oak Ridge, Tennessee) and MGK (born on April 22, 1990, at 9:00 a.m. in Houston) were born while the sun moved through the grounded, resolutely fixed&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>earth sign Taurus</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Given their conjunct suns, Fox and Kelly likely feel like they just&nbsp;get&nbsp;one another innately. This could very well explain why they had such a speedy, instant connection. Sharing the same sun sign as your partner can help you feel like you're very much on the same page, have similar perspectives, and share your core values. For two Taureans, that means an emphasis on creature comforts, style, and home life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although it's just one piece of your bigger&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>natal chart</a>, sharing a sun sign with your partner means you also share the same flaws. In this case, Taurus, symbolized by the Bull, can be hard-headed and slow to take action on just about anything. So, if you're uncomfortable with something about yourself and your partner reflects it back to you, awkwardness or tension could ensue. It's a case of loving yourself as much as your S.O.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-venus-connection></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Venus Connection</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kelly was born with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Venus</a>&nbsp;— the planet of love, beauty, and money — in Pisces. Venus' placement influences how you behave in relationships and how you attract others. It sits right on Fox's Jupiter, which is how she makes her luck and experiences abundance, so it's no surprise they feel so fortunate about their relationship — and that it's bringing them even more fame and success.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This watery connection underlines just how sensitive, tender, and truly romantic they are with one another. They're both empaths, a bit psychic, and super compassionate poets at heart. That absolutely explains the lovey-dovey posts the two share, like this one from Valentine's Day 2021: "There goes my heart manifest outside of my body draped in the towering silhouette of a most unusually handsome boy," Fox wrote about Kelly in a since-deleted post on Instagram. "The journey will likely be perilous but there is no destination without him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition, Fox's Jupiter is at 17 degrees Pisces, while Kelly's moon is at 25 degrees Pisces. If there was ever a sign of true adoration, tender affection, and feeling downright lucky in love, it's a moon-Jupiter aspect like this. These two absolutely know how to nurture and care for one another. With such a strong emotional connection in such a romantic sign, it's no wonder the Internet's so mesmerized by Kelly and Fox as a duo.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mercury-conjunction></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mercury Conjunction</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's one thing for Fox and Kelly to have such strong Venus and Venus-moon conjunctions that lend themselves to how they love one another, but they're also very much on the same page in terms of how they think and communicate, thanks to a strong&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mercury conjunction</a>. Fox was born with the planet of information at 16 degrees of Taurus, while Kelly was born with his at 17 degrees of Taurus.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a result, both tend to speak in a direct, grounded, measured, and possibly super diplomatic way. Thanks to Taurus's fixed, resolute nature, they might be a bit slow to start projects, but once they're in, they're all in and will see something through to the end. This conjunction could very well point to the pair being able to see themselves signing up for the long haul.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another interesting Mercury aspect: Fox's Mars (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the planet of action and sex</a>) is in Capricorn at 19 degrees, forming a harmonizing trine to Kelly's Mercury in Taurus, which points to the couple's ability to think and act as a team. Fox likely inspires Kelly to make big moves to make his ideas real — especially because the trine is happening in two industrious, hardworking earth signs.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-couples-romantic-future></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Couple's Romantic Future</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With charts that match and harmonize with one another so beautifully, Fox and Kelly have a uniquely heightened ability to communicate, love, and work together. With such strong astrological compatibility, their love story is no doubt an example of "when you know, you know."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Usually, when you know, you seal the deal with an engagement, as MGK did. The day that he proposed, the moon, which can drive up emotional sensitivity, was in Taurus, hovering right over not only Fox's sun but the couple's Mercury conjunction, indicating an emotionally charged conversation. Mars, the planet of sex and action, hit Fox's Uranus, the planet of sudden change, so it's quite possible that she was actually surprised by the proposal. As if that wasn't enough, lucky Jupiter, now in dreamy Pisces, had just formed a conjunction with MGK's Mars — magnifying his desire to make a move — and is about to form a harmonizing Grand Trine with his Jupiter in Cancer and her Pluto in Scorpio indicating a major, fortunate change for the couple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their fateful engagement really goes to show these two were cut from the same starry cloth. Two dreamers who feel the weight and pain of the world personally, they're both pros at channeling those tough emotions into their work. Now, they have one another for support along the way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Stars Align is our column analyzing the astrological compatibility of the buzziest celebrity couples.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8Csq6unnKS0unvMnp6apl2bvLl5zJqaoaGemnqowc1mop6knK56or%2FTq6alp5eesKK4jJympqiRqbajtcuiq7I%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
