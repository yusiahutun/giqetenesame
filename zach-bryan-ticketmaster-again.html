Despite <a href=#>boycotting</a> the ticketing service last year, the budding singer says he can't change the system on his own.</p><p>“Everyone complained about AXS last year. Using all ticketing sites this year,” Bryan&nbsp;explains on social media. “All my homies still do hate Ticketmaster, but hard to realize one guy can’t change the whole system."</p><p>"It is intentionally broken and I’ll continue to feel absolutely horrible about the cost of tickets in an unfair market,” he stresses.</p><p>Fed up with overprices tickets being sold through Ticketmaster — even to his own shows — the "I Remember Everything" singer attempted to sell tickets for his Burn, Burn, Burn Tour exclusively through a competing service, AXS.</p><p>“I have met kids at my shows who have paid upwards of four-hundred bucks to be there and I’m done with it,” Bryan posted on social media last December.</p><p>"I’m so tired of people saying things can’t be done about this massive issue while huge monopolies sit there stealing money from working class people,” he added.</p><p>To take things a step further, Bryan also made his position known by titling his live album at the time All My Homies Hate Ticketmaster.</p><p>The issues with the ticketing site <a href=#>came to a head</a>&nbsp;last fall, when<a href=#> Taylor Swift</a> fans experienced extremely long waits to get their hands on tickets to her Eras Tour, only to be forcibly logged out of Ticketmaster empty-handed. Meanwhile, resale sites were posting tickets at prices as high as $28,000.</p><p>An investigation into the site was launched. The Department of Justice also questioned Ticketmaster's merger with Live Nation, which possibly caused a market monopoly.</p><p>Bryan's <a href=#>Quittin' Time Tour</a> is scheduled to begin on March 6 in Chicago, with several stadium dates included. Jason Isbell, Sheryll Crow and Turnpike Troubadours have been confirmed as openers.</p><p>Tickets will be sold to the general public&nbsp;starting Friday (Sept. 8).</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>10 Artists We Totally Underestimated</h2><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oliver Anthony</a> is country music's newest underdog but he's just next in line on a list of hitmakers that fans, the media and the music industry scoffed at.This list of 10 artists we underestimated includes at least five legitimate superstars with dozens of No. 1 hits, two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Idol</a> finalists and country music's first real viral sensation.
