Barring boyfriends (<a href=#>sorry, sorry Corey!</a>) and based on a series of strict criteria — who’s cheated on his wife, who’s a good father or a good husband, what would his own Sunday night show be — Vulture has decided who is Big Little Lies’ best betrothed.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjyaev7xk001p3h66gfyxmbgu@published>Gordon Klein</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d01/749/f8cfdd4a6c45438a2402e147fe9f7fbc22-19-big-little-lies-husbands.rsquare.w400.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjyaewu1s00243h66emlhdklr@published data-word-count=36><strong>Has he cheated on his wife? </strong>Last season, I would’ve said no.
