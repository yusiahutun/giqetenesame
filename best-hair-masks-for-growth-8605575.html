But getting your hair to grow faster and healthier is harder than it sounds, and you'll need specific products with specific ingredients to boost your efforts. “Hair masks can contribute to overall hair health by addressing factors that can influence hair growth,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Dr. Isfahan Chambers-Harris</a>, a Presidential STEM Fellow at the National Institute of Health, and trichologist. Most notably, these hair masks specifically developed for growth, she says, “can revive and support a healthy scalp, nourish strands, and prevent future damage, and these are all factors that contribute to an environment beneficial to hair growth.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Is there such a thing as having hair that looks too <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>voluminous</a> or too healthy? We think not, and over six weeks, a team of InStyle editors tested 15 popular hair masks for hair growth in search of the very best. We judged each one on the immediate and long-term benefits and visible results they delivered directly to our strands: Improved hydration and hair strength, healthy hair that feels touchable and soft, and most importantly, if our hair was noticeably thicker, fuller, healthier at the end of the six-week test. These are the 10 hair masks that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>InStyle editors</a> — and their newfound bouncy ‘90s supermodel hair — loved the most.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-briogeo-avocado--kiwi-mega-moisture-superfood-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Briogeo Avocado + Kiwi Mega Moisture Superfood Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Briogeo Avocado + Kiwi Mega Moisture Superfood Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YYeEEKSfZLp0APjBrl2dBRFvugA=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/briogeo-avocado-kiwi-mega-moisture-superfood-mask-c36eeb30df1f49a38ee04b1b818b8a28.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This vegan, cruelty-free mask doubles as a deep conditioning treatment.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: It does very little to help combat frizz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made with Briogeo’s proprietary Nova Complex, specifically designed to support healthy hair, this vegan and 96 percent naturally derived mask earned our highest marks and landed the top spot of best overall. Formulated with avocado oil and chia seed oils to supercharge our hair’s hydration levels, along with a who’s who of hair strengtheners, like amino acids and minerals, to promote all-over hair health. Within three weeks, our hair looked significantly fuller, and it only got better. At six weeks, we saw new hair growth, while also noticing we had fewer split ends, and stronger, more hydrated hair overall.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved the thick creamy formula and were surprised at how fast such a rich mask just melted right into our hair. And we saw immediate results straight from the jump — after our first treatment, our curls looked shiny, vibrant, and super defined, even without using any styling gels or oils. Although the brand recommends letting the mask soak into your hair for 30 minutes, we tapped out around 20 minutes just because we ran out of time, but the sweet, fruity scent made the entire experience feel so lovely.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Avocado oil, kiwi extract, chia seed oil, spinach｜<strong>Sulfate-Free:</strong> No｜<strong>Usage</strong>: 1x a week｜<strong>Size</strong>: 8 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-mielle-organics-rosemary-mint-strengthening-hair-masque></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Strengthening Hair Masque</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Strengthening Hair Masque" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/A4cH9t0KOJdFJdRpLzMp2ou0glo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rosemary-mint-strengthening-hair-masque-f001f76b5ca8473bb40527993faa6d8f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It washes out quickly and easily, adding minimal time to your hair care routine.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: You might need a little (or a lot) more product than the instructions suggest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Protective styles are invaluable for promoting hair growth by shielding hair from physical damage, heat, and humidity, but taking hair down from a protective style can leave it in desperate need of deep conditioning. Enter: Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Strengthening Hair Masque. This drugstore favorite zhuzhed our formerly dry strands, fresh out of a protective style, feeling full and strong. Our blow-outs appeared softer and smoother with hardly any flyaways, and even better, we noticed a lot less shedding than we usually see right after a protective hairstyle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This biotin-infused mask is thick, but it spreads easily and melts quickly into our hair. After a few uses, we found that rubbing a bit of product in our hands first before applying gave it a flexible paste-like texture for more slip and easier distribution. It's application was also unique — you sandwich it between the shampoo and conditioning steps as a way to restore some of the hydration from the shampoo.&nbsp;A unique perk of this mask is that it also benefits the scalp, as rosemary helps stimulate and improve circulation and honey acts as a moisturizer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Rosemary, mentha oil, honey, coconut oil｜<strong>Sulfate-Free:</strong> Yes｜<strong>Usage</strong>: 1x per week｜<strong>Size</strong>: 12 oz</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2331 data-sizes=750px alt="A person's hair after using Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Strengthening Hair Masque" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lRXhMzRz31-Cw1LD8UMWdyGBOFg=/fit-in/1500x2331/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-hair-growth-masks-conditioners-test-mielle-organics-strengthening-victoria-phillips-during-2-2d69ce69f7b949eeba65b7ee5e5582f6.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Victoria Phillips</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2497 data-sizes=750px alt="A person while using the Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Strengthening Hair Masque" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lDX1ow_Uuhnex8EBjFVJHRsPj08=/fit-in/1500x2497/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-hair-growth-masks-conditioners-test-mielle-organics-strengthening-victoria-phillips-before-2-d8b6ef49fca8432cb867944e08c308dc.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Victoria Phillips</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hair-mask-for-growth-and-repair-amika-the-kure-intense-bond-repair-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hair Mask for Growth and Repair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amika The Kure</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amika The Kure Intense Bond Repair Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QpFmRBLLVISwrXF0sEj5kdBxkyI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amika-the-kure-intense-bond-repair-mask-facd35f963d04a5082fbdf6c8a5f3b11.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This gluten-free formula has a perfume-like scent that sticks around long after you’ve rinsed out the product.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: Its thick creamy texture may be too heavy for thin and fine hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Trying to hydrate our dry hair or reverse the scraggly damage on our brittle can can be as slow-going as watching paint dry, but after using this Amika mask once a week, we never have to suffer slow results ever again. Our first impression was that it looked like an intense body butter, although it didn’t feel excessively oily, and the texture actually transformed into a much lighter texture as we massaged it into our hair. Then we thought that such an intensely hydrating mask would be a slog to rinse out fully, but again, we were wrong; in fact, it washed off faster than some lighter masks we tried.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At the end of six weeks, our thick and hopelessly dry hair (formerly, that is), felt significantly stronger, softer, and much more hydrated. Not only did our revamped hair feel stronger and healthier, but helped to control our annoyingly stubborn frizz — a battle we thought we lost long ago — leaving us with hair that looked far smoother, softer, and shinier than it had in years. Given its intensity, this mask is likely too rich for thin or fine hair. As a bonus, we also noticed less shedding in both the shower and daily brushing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Sea buckthorn, borage oil, shea butter, mango butter｜<strong>Sulfate-Free:</strong> Yes｜<strong>Usage</strong>: 1x per week｜<strong>Size</strong>: 8.4 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-hair-growth-and-thickness-kevin-murphy-young-again-masque></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Hair Growth and Thickness</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kevin Murphy Young Again Masque</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kevin Murphy Young Again Masque" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yLIyiDcAG4L9mZFdqrqROrOvwgE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kevin-murphy-young-again-masque-15522628fa98434696a2ba94b2501e73.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kevin Murphy</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: The rejuvenating formula is lightweight enough for fine and thin hair.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: The pump bottle is difficult to open and get working.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Formulated with a unique blend of lotus flower extract, known for its soothing properties, orchid flower extract, and bamboo extract, Kevin Murphy’s Young Again Masque is jam-packed with moisture nourishment — a must-have for people with flat, dry-looking strands. This mask also struck that perfect Goldilocks balance of not being too heavy or too light, but just right for our fine hair to soak it up without looking or feeling weighed down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After our very first use, our lifeless hair had transformed into something of a masterpiece: Lifted roots, lots of body and bounce, along with a glossy finish. We had never had much luck finding a conditioning mask that worked for our fine hair, resulting in brittle, dry ends that seemed to break off at every minor inconvenience or gust of wind, preventing us from getting the length we wanted. By hydrating and strengthening our strands, this mask rocked our hair world, and finally, our newly strengthened hair started to grow at the end of the six-week test, and we're still using it to see if it'll continue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Lotus flower extract, orchid flower extract, bamboo extract｜<strong>Sulfate-Free:</strong> Yes｜<strong>Usage</strong>: 1x per week｜<strong>Size</strong>: 200 ml</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overnight-hair-mask-for-growth-k18-biomimetic-hairscience-leave-in-molecular-repair-hair-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overnight Hair Mask for Growth</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Molecular Repair Hair Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="K18 Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wJZ8rMEJKGIfqNW38FQzMbpZieA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/k18-leave-in-molecular-repair-mask-a3b21afa3fca4db3b79a853abf48cdf0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: It only needs to sit for four minutes before styling and replaces the conditioner step in your hair care routine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: It can take several uses to see dramatic results on exceptionally damaged hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Achieving thicker, fuller hair often begins with repairing damage for optimal hair health, and K18’s Leave-In Molecular Repair Mask is as effective as it is time-saving. We found that just a little bit of this lightweight leave-in cream goes a long way, and within just four minutes, we were done — no rinsing, no stickiness, just damp hair that felt exactly the same as our regular wet hair, ready for styling. The brand’s proprietary K18 Peptide is clinically proven to restore hair damage due to chemical treatments, dye, and too much heat styling — and we watched it transform our dull, frizzy strands, riddled with split ends, to fuller, smoother, and healthier looking hair IN six weeks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re always nervous that leave-ins will make the hair feel greasy or leave a film behind, but this mask absorbs quickly and makes hair washing a much easier process.

With a rich, creamy consistency, this formula is exactly what you’d imagine a deeply hydrating mask would be. We must say, however, that it felt kind of weird to scoop out of the tub — it reminded us of the slime we played with as kids — but the gel formula paid dividends in the form of instantly silky, soft hair the minute we rinsed out. And unlike so many other deep conditioning treatments with shine-boosting properties, it didn’t leave a weird film over our hair, or any hint of residue at all.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We can’t exactly say we noticed our hair growing any faster by the end of six weeks, although according to NYC-based celebrity stylist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Jay Martin</a>, deeply hydrating masks like this one strengthen hair overall, which encourages new growth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Karmatin, marula oil, moringa seed oil, milk thistle｜<strong>Sulfate-Free:</strong> Yes｜<strong>Usage</strong>: 1x per week｜<strong>Size</strong>: 5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-split-ends-and-growth-krastase-genesis-masque-reconstituant-hair-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Split Ends and Growth</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kérastase Genesis Masque Reconstituant Hair Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Kerastase Genesis Masque Reconstituant Hair Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/75Ey8ycU37Ioe_FyEpiFE4ctJ-Q=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kerastase-genesis-masque-reconstituant-hair-mask-e77afd8b5ae44b30a43b72a66702148f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: Its natural, fresh, and clean scent.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: It has to be applied to towel-dried hair, then rinsed, meaning you either have to get back into the shower or rinse your hair over the sink after your shower.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thinning hair has many causes, some of which are biological, and some that are the result of breaking and brushing already weakened hair.

Its primary active ingredient is Fiaschetto tomato extract, which is chock-full of antioxidants and vitamin C, to protect the hair while stimulating growth. It also made the formula smell delicious. The only downside is the time investment — it needs to sit on hair for 10 to 15 minutes, which felt like forever, and if we didn't wait, we didn't see massive results.

Vitamin A, while not a protein. is a mighty strengthener to help prevent split ends and breakage.<p>“Niacin, or vitamin B3, improves blood flow to the hair follicles, improving nutrient and oxygen delivery to the hair follicles, which promotes faster hair growth,” explains Chambers-Harris, adding that some ingredients are better for specific hair types than others. "For curly or coily hair, hydrating ingredients like argan oil or panthenol can provide moisture, strength and enhance curl definition, and thin or fine hair benefits from zinc, grapeseed extract, and B vitamins."</p></li><li readability=6><strong>Protein-Packed Formula: </strong>A trio of proteins — keratin, biotin, and collagen — are called the building blocks of healthy hair, meaning you can find them in almost every strengthening or hair growth mask. “Keratin is a fibrous protein that is a key structural component of hair, nails, and the outer layer of the skin, and it repairs damage by filling in gaps and cracks within each hair strand,” explains Chambers-Harris, adding that biotin, or vitamin B7, is known to reduce hair thinning while also preventing dryness within hair or scalp.&nbsp;<p>“Collagen is responsible for hair’s elasticity and bounce, which translates into less breakage, fewer split ends, and staving off future damage, all of which work to preserve hair structure, leading to more growth.</p></li><li readability=23><strong>Plant, Seed, or Fruit-Based Oils: </strong>“Nourishing and hydrating the hair are essential for maintaining overall hair health because they help address various factors that contribute to the strength, appearance, and resilience of the hair,” says Chambers-Harris.<p>“If hair is over processed, dry and unhealthy, it simply will not grow as well as it normally would,” says Martin, adding that this is especially true of people who overdo it with daily heat styling tools. "Using masks and other hair products that add hydration and nourishment to the hair replaces the protein, keratin, and moisture that we strip out doing all of those things to support growth.”</p><p>Plant-based and seed extracts contain vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals to ramp up hair health. Look for Martin's favorites, rosemary and lavender oils, along with Chamber-Harris's go-tos, coconut oil, jojoba oil, and sweet almond oil. “Coconut oil penetrates the hair shaft, providing deep conditioning and has antimicrobial properties that can benefit scalp health," says Dr. Chambers-Harris, adding that jojoba oil helps control excess sebum that weighs down hair and sweet almond oil is the cherry on top for a shiny finish.</p></li><li readability=15><strong>Scalp Health: </strong>“A healthy scalp provides a supportive environment for hair follicles, ensuring optimal conditions for hair to grow,” says Chambers-Harris. Regular cleansing, a healthy, balanced diet, and avoid products with harsh chemicals will help keep your scalp healthy.<p>“Sometimes products, especially dry shampoo and hairspray, build up on the scalp causing blockages at the follicle,” says Martin, who says the easy fix is simply brushing your hair before hopping in the shower to loosen build-up. “Use a clarifying shampoo once every few weeks to give the scalp a deep clean."</p><p>Flakey scalps should kick it up a notch and look for specific ingredients, like anti-inflammatory aloe vera, tingly peppermint oil that brings more blood flow to the scalp, and moisturizing, antibacterial honey, to wipe them out and create a base that is primed and ready for healthy hair growth.<br></p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered<br></span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can hair masks help hair growth?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Hair masks can contribute to overall hair health and may indirectly support hair growth by addressing factors that can influence the hair growth,” says Chambers-Harris. “Most hair masks do not directly stimulate new hair follicle formation, but they can promote a healthy scalp, nourish the hair strands, and prevent damage, and these are all factors that contribute to an environment beneficial to hair growth.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hair masks work alongside a healthy diet, other quality hair products, and gentle hair care practices to help facilitate hair growth.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What mask makes hair grow faster?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there is no mask that can single-handedly make your hair grow faster, they do whip unhealthy hair into shape, because no hair will grow quickly on a backed-up scalp with clogged hair follicles or brittle ends.
