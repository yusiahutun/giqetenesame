He’s entertained us from his earliest roles in 1983’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Class</a> and 1984’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sixteen Candles</a>, through his later work, which has included a role on 2020’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime</a> sci-fi conspiracy thriller series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Utopia</a>. For that project, he played biotech specialist Dr. Kevin Christie, who had “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">almost a sense of a dystopian Willy Wonka to the character,</a>” he said.</p><p>The best and most popular John Cusack movies (see our list, below) are sure to never be forgotten by his fans, who revel in watching them over and over.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s weird, it’s like having your yearbook pictures on cable all the time</a>,” Cusack told Sunday Today of different periods of his life, both personal and professional, being cemented in time for audiences. “It’s nice that people still are actually thinking or talking about some of those old movies.”</p><p>The 40-year Hollywood veteran can even boast to leaving some fellow celebs speechless at times throughout his career. <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recently admitted that he was “starstruck” </a>the first time he saw Cusack right after moving to LA. “I saw John Cusack, and that was the first I had ever seen a man or woman who actually worked in film,” Pitt shared. “It was really strange, being in the same room with someone who you watched on the screen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/2-35.jpg><p>Other A-list celebs were all too eager to sing Cusack’s praises when he earned his star on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> more than a decade ago. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Aykroyd</a> lauded Cusack for being “the thinking man and thinking woman’s actor, exec producer and writer. Everything that John does has substance,” said the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Saturday Night Live</a> legend, who appeared John Cusack movies, 1997’s Grosse Pointe Blank and 2008’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">War, Inc</a>.</p><p>“Most actors don’t give a crap about other people in the movie,” added <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Black</a>, who was in 1992’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bob Roberts</a>, 1999’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cradle Will Rock</a> and 2000’s High Fidelity with Cusack. “They’re looking out for No. 1. It’s a cutthroat every-man-for-himself kind of biz. That’s why I thank my lucky stars I got to work with such an incredible artist and a class act of a menschy good-stuff potato of a man.”</p><p>Not surprisingly, it was John’s sister <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joan</a> — “When I’m producing a movie, I know I can get her cheap,” he’s joked — who had the most emotional praise for Cusack, both as an actor and a man. “John is a star. There’s magic in him,” she said, describing her brother as “part <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s a Wonderful Life</a>, part <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Strangelove</a>, and part <a href=#>Charlie Brown Christmas</a>.” And, she added of his humble nature, “if you’re lucky enough to be in his sight, [he] will suddenly shorten his 6’3” frame by spreading his feet apart to look you in the eye and make you feel like the star, every time.”</p><p>Read on to discover our favorite John Cusack movies that have been highlights of his impressive career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. The Grifters (1990)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Never con a con! Roger Ebert raved that “the performances are all insidiously powerful” in this story about a small-time con man (Cusack) and his complicated relationships with two much more experienced grifters, his mother (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anjelica Huston</a>) and his girlfriend (<a href=#>Annette Bening</a>). The role, for which he learned real card and dice tricks from the pros, was “a wonderfully twisted role to dive into,” Cusack said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Better Off Dead… (1995)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>In this “abnormal look at a normal teenager,” according to its original trailer, this classic teen-angst title finds Cusack’s character dumped by his girlfriend and depressed, though his attempts to stop his suffering somehow just get increasingly more embarrassing. “It was this surreal teen comedy, and I thought, ‘Wow, when am I going to get a chance to do this again?’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People still really like that film</a>,” Cusack noted to Entertainment Weekly.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. The Sure Thing (1985)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“Eight o’clock? I don’t know. That’s when I rearrange my sock drawer.” “All the good lines are given to Cusack” as college freshman Gib, according to the Washington Post. This mid-80s Rob Reiner gem “stirs memories of Hollywood’s great classic, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It Happened One Night</a>,” added the Associated Press, and Cusack is a standout in one of his earliest lead roles. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daphne Zuniga</a> co-stars as his will-they-or-won’t-they love interest.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Eight Men Out (1988)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>In this film about the baseball “scandal that broke the heart of a nation,” Cusack had some fun on the job playing Chicago White Sox infielder <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buck Weaver</a>, who was involved in helping to throw the 1919 World Series. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m a big baseball fan</a>,” Cusack shared. “[Shooting] that was like a childhood dream. I remember going to the old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Comiskey [Park]</a> and standing on the same dirt…where <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Babe Ruth</a> stood. I was taking ground balls and doing batting practice, thinking ‘This is the greatest. I’m totally the luckiest bastard on the face of the earth.’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“I’m invited to my ten-year high school reunion. What am I gonna say? ‘I killed the president of Paraguay with a fork. How have you been?’” In what MovieWeb calls John Cusack’s “best rom-com,” he plays Martin Blank, an assassin who takes a break back in his hometown, reigniting a relationship with an old flame (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Minnie Driver</a>) until work — and a rival (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Aykroyd</a>) — start pulling his focus. The black comedy, for which Cusack co-produced and co-wrote the script, “flies on Cusack’s seductive malevolence. He is a marvel,” Rolling Stone raved.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Love & Mercy (2014)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“He was a genius, he was ahead of his time,” Cusack said at a 2019 Atlanta event about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Beach Boys</a>’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brian Wilson</a>, whom he portrays in this engaging biopic. “I’m happy he and [wife] Melinda were happy with the film because it’s his life,” added the actor, who co-stars with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Banks</a> as the musician’s manager and wife, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Melinda Ledbetter</a>. “The guy who plays me, John Cusack, he’s really good. And he sings well,” Wilson told the Houston Press of the good vibrations he got from watching the actor’s portrayal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Bullets Over Broadway (1994)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Cusack shines in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Woody Allen</a>’s backstage comedy as a 1920s playwright who makes a deal with the devil — a mob boss — to finance his new project. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Tilly</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dianne Wiest</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chazz Palminteri</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tracey Ullman</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Reiner</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvey Fierstein</a> co-star, and Newsweek raved that the way Cusack and the rest of the A-list cast “feast upon their roles is contagious. This is ham cured and roasted to farcical perfection.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. High Fidelity (2000)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Esquire not only named this the “truest Chicago movie ever,” but also hometown hero Cusack’s “finest hour.” “I’ll take that compliment,” noted the star and screenplay co-writer of the accolades, and this winning film sure does have a standout cast: Jack Black, Iben Hjejle, Joan Cusack, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Louiso</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Bonet</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lili Taylor</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Robbins</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>. The movie —about a struggling record store owner (Cusack) who’s unlucky in love — also not surprisingly has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a killer soundtrack</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Being John Malkovich (1999)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“It’s my heeeeeead!” It’s hard to stand out in a film titled after one of your co-stars, but Cusack was up for the challenge in this quirky, award-winning cult favorite directed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spike Jonze</a>. Cusack told The A.V. Club that he went to his agents and said, “Give me the craziest, most unproduceable script you can find,” and the result was this film about a puppeteer who discovers a portal into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Malkovich</a>’s mind. It earned Cusack a Best Male Lead nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards, and he and his co-stars (including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron Diaz</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Catherine Keener </a>and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charlie Sheen</a>) were nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Outstanding Performance by a Cast award as well.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Say Anything (1989)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Though you’re probably instantly imagining <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Gabriel</a>’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“In Your Eyes” playing on a boom box</a> as Cusack’s Lloyd Dobler holds it up over his head so Diane (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ione Skye</a>) could hear it, “There’s a lot of complexity to the film, actually,” Cusack has said. “It might have some of the core of teen films, in that there might be some concessions to the genre, but at the heart of it, it’s not a teen movie,” he added of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deeper themes surrounding his character</a>. Still, looking back at its success, he’s not picky about how people choose to remember this beloved classic, even if most people approach him about that boom box scene. “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I figure, you know, that’s kind of a champagne problem, right?</a> I think if that’s as tough as it’s going to get for me, I’m a pretty lucky guy,” Cusack told Sunday Today.</p><p><strong>For more of your favorite actors, keep reading…</strong></p><p><a href=#>Pedro Pascal Is Hollywood’s Newest Heartthrob: Here His Best Movies & TV Shows</a></p><p><a href=#>Ryan Gosling Movies: Our 10 Favorite Films Starring the Talented Hunk, Ranked</a></p><p><a href=#>Steve Martin Movies and TV Shows: From ‘The Jerk’ to ‘Only Murders in the Building’</a></p><p><a href=#>Sylvester Stallone Movies: His Biggest and Best Knockout Films Through The Years</a></p><p><a href=#>‘Paul Newman Movies: 19 Rare Photos of The Screen Idol’s 50-Year Career</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2BfvKm6jJysrJmToHquu9WinKw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
