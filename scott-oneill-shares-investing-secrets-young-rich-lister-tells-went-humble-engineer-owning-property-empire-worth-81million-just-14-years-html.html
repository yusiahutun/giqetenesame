trainee engineer before he decided to try his hand at property investing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2009, using a deposit painstakingly squirrelled away from years working low-level jobs, the then 23-year-old university graduate bought his first house - a four-bedroom fixer-upper in <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-79bd0590-9fb2-11ee-9c3a-33d970296b93>Sydney</a>'s Sutherland Shire.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fast forward to 2023 and Scott, along with his wife Mina, have earned a spot on the country's Young Rich List with an $81million empire spanning more than 20 properties, a buyer's agency called Rethink Investing, and a holiday house in <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-00bba8b0-9fa6-11ee-9c3a-33d970296b93>Greece</a> where the young family spend half their year.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr O'Neill said that during the initial stages of his property investment journey one of the first things he did to grow his original $60,000 deposit was to generate equity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Equity is the difference between how much a borrower still owes on a property and what it is worth or, in other words, how much profit they would make if it sold.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I did this&nbsp;by renovating residential properties, often with my own hands,' Mr O'Neill told Daily Mail Australia.</p><img id=i-f0f9625aee17b433

property portfolio worth $81million that has landed them on the Young Rich List</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mortgage holders can use the equity on their home as security with banks to borrow more, which can be used to fund renovations or branch out into another investment property.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr O'Neill said that while 'saving that initial deposit took a lot of time and effort' once he was in the market he was able to see consistent growth by doing his research and choosing the right properties to buy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'My first job was in McDonald's at 14, then I washed cars at dealerships, I was a surveyor field hand, then four years working in hospitality servicing poker machines, doing bar work and event management.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I had about nine months under my belt from working as an engineer as well.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said in his first decade in property investing his wealth snowballed comparatively quickly by taking advantage of the bullish property market, which shows little sign of slowing in 2024 despite a series of interest rate hikes.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We leveraged as much as we could over that 10-year period into high growth properties, with upside and great cashflow... that's been instrumental in sustaining our success.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium mol-style-bold news-ccox">Scott's advice for those looking to invest in property</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr O'Neill said while residential property had provided their entry to investing, there were two 'pivotal moments' that 'changed the game'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We strata titled unit blocks, which is a process of acquiring assets on a single title and then subdividing ownership into multiple titles.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This effectively increases square metre rates from a valuation and sale point of view.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the big one, he said, was the addition of commercial properties to their portfolio.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The upside (anticipated price increase) and cash flow from this asset class far surpassed the returns we were achieving in the residential sector.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'For example, we would create six-figure profits from signing up a new lease.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The couple, both in their mid-30s, went from a wholly residential property portfolio to about 50 per cent commercial by 2017, and then to about 95 per cent this year.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The types of projects they focus on include smaller neighbourhood developments like retail strips, dental and medical clinics, and childcare centres in smaller capital cities such as Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth and regional cities like Townsville.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-1cedc3002282a86

industry</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr O'Neill said the recent interest rate rises have had a 'brutal impact' on the residential market and led to diminishing returns and mortgage stress for many home owners.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Official figures show about 1.5million Australians will be under mortgage stress in 2024, defined as spending a third of disposable income on loan repayments.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mr O'Neill said that for investors in the current climate 'cashflow is king' and both experienced and novice investors should consider often overlooked commercial properties.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There is a scarcity of houses driving up prices but there is a similar shortage in certain categories of commercial assets.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'For example in Australia, industrial properties are at a vacancy rate of 0.8 per cent, which is the tightest among developed nations.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'This shortage in turn drives up rents, which is a favourable development for investors'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium mol-style-bold news-ccox">Investors turned book publishers&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As well as founding and staying on as managing director of the Rethink Group of companies, Mr O'Neill has also authored a best-selling book on commercial property investing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The 2nd edition of the book was written in early 2023 as Mina and I were busy with our day jobs at Rethink, so we had to do a page at a time at night.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It was slow process and a challenge separating what was going in the book and what we were emailing our clients with during the day. It all blurred into one.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a point-of-difference to many financial gurus, the concepts in Mr O'Neill's book are backed up by actual experience with Rethink sourcing commercial properties for more than 3,500 clients, worth more than $3billion, since 2015.</p><img id=i-5aefe2cc14c2ec24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/22/00/79202931-12879769-Scott_and_Mina_O_Neill_are_Australia_s_top_commercial_property_i-a-12_1703204118723.jpg height=489 width=306 alt="Scott and Mina O'Neill are Australia's top commercial property investment experts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-f3f6688d54446aaf src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/12/22/00/79202933-12879769-They_have_recently_completed_the_second_ediction_of_their_best_s-a-13_1703204118801.jpg height=489 width=306 alt="They have recently completed the second edition of their best-selling book" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Scott and Mina are considered among Australia's top commercial property investing experts and have recently released the second edition of their best-selling book</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'We aimed to release the second edition of this book to incorporate additional statistics and share our insights into the commercial market, reflecting our increased maturity as investors since the first edition.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Notably, we've assisted our clients in acquiring a substantial additional sum, totalling a couple of billion dollars in commercial property since the initial release.

Have a budget with all your property-related expenses and income sources. Define your financial objectives and adhere to an investment strategy. Save for future property acquisitions and as a buffer for unforeseen expenses. And avoid excessive debt.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>- <span class=mol-style-bold>In commercial property, value-adds can be particularly rewarding</span>. Look for properties with untapped potential or areas where improvements can be made. Renovations, strategic upgrades, and tenant incentives can boost both cashflow and property value.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>- <span class=mol-style-bold>Off-market sales</span> often provide opportunities for more favourable negotiations and reduced competition. Build a network of real estate professionals and industry contacts to grant you access to off-market properties that aren't widely advertised.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>- <span class=mol-style-bold>Get a team of experts </span>who specialise in commercial real estate including a buyer's agent, property managers, accountants, financial advisors, and legal experts. Each member plays a critical role in helping you make informed decisions, navigate complex transactions, and ensure long-term profitability.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>- <span class=mol-style-bold>Equip yourself with knowledge about the market</span> and consult with a mortgage broker, such as Rethink Financing, to assess your budget and determine the most suitable types of commercial assets within your financial parameters.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>- For budgets below $1 million, <span class=mol-style-bold>industrial properties are often a reliable option</span>. Above $1 million, various strong retail investments, including national brands, could be considered. And in the multiple millions, childcare facilities and supermarkets with long and secure leases become viable considerations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc4SWcm5vcV%2BIsLDA02aGh52Zobluv8eaqZ6rXZ67t7HSraCnn12osqS%2BxK2qZpGfqruoebGimqFlfJ7AtbHRZquepJyoerixza1koa2dl7mmecSnnqKmlZq%2FbrvWp6Cnn12lv7C8xKursmWVor2qvsRmrqiqpJ16eX3MoqOloZ%2BjeqvB0q1kamxdrrKivtJnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
