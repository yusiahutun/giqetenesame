Graded by Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) as a 'Mint 9', the one-of-one card became an item of major interest after Verstappen won the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix earlier in March.</p><p>Verstappen, 25, is already on course for his third consecutive F1 world championship and is spearheading a new era of success for <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Red Bull</a>. And collectors would appear to agree his rise isn't due to end anytime soon considering the eyewatering sum spent on this latest piece of sports memorabilia.</p><p><b>READ NOW: </b><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Max Verstappen's dad criticised after reaction to Sergio Perez's win caught on camera</a></b></p><p>It's understood the sale is the second-highest on record for a Verstappen card, second only to the 2020 Topps Chrome Superfractor Auto—also a Mint 9—reportedly sold for $534,000 in August last year.</p><p>That was only three months after a <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Lewis Hamilton</a> one-of-one Superfractor Topps card became the most expensive F1 trading card of all time, selling for a whopping $900,000 (around £745,000) by renowned auctioneers Goldin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29378996.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_F1-Grand-Prix-of-Bahrain.jpg><p>“When an athlete lives up to the hype as Verstappen has, collectors pay attention," said PWCC Marketplace's vice-president of sales, Jesse Craig, when this latest Verstappen card was listed. “He dominated in the Bahrain Grand Prix, diminishing doubts left over from last season. And he has positioned himself as a front-runner for nearly every single race this season.</p><p>"It’s always exciting to see a star athlete’s trading card market heat up. If he continues to perform at this calibre, this is just the beginning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29514274.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_s-l500jpeg.jpg><p>This is a one-of-one card so the chance of it hitting the market again any time soon is highly unlikely. If Verstappen continues to perform at this high of a caliber this card will likely be in a high-end collection for a long time.”</p><p>The odds of pulling Verstappen's 2020 Chrome Formula 1 Sapphire Edition Padparadscha are understood to be around one in 605. However, the item sold by PWCC is thought to be the only one in existence—as far as collectors are aware—to date.</p><p><b><i>What's the most remarkable sports auction sale you've ever heard of?

Team-mate Sergio Perez won in Jeddah, but Verstappen has maintained the slimmest of leads in the overall standings, sitting one point clear in search of his third straight world title.</p><p>Although he made his F1 debut as a youngster in 2015, Verstappen has time on his hands to cement his legacy as one of F1's greats, aided by a period of engineering superiority at Red Bull. One would imagine his trading card prices will only continue to climb should he maintain current standards, with F1 steadily rising in popularity among investors.</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Red Bull team-mates Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez in awkward chat over fastest lap</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>F1 fans slam ‘softest safety car ever’ gifting Red Bull one two and Max Verstappen podium</a></b></p></li><li><p><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow><b>Max Verstappen sends ominous message to rivals as Red Bull fans say 'we're cooking'</b></a></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Lando Norris left raging at 'dangerous' Max Verstappen ahead of Saudi Grand Prix</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Max Verstappen's girlfriend Kelly Piquet wows F1 fans again with latest beach outfit</a></b></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8VqZqaZqGLDpr7SrZipqJWjerW%2BwJ2gp59dmK6zsIyarJysmaS7bn6YbmhsaGlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
