Its construction is deceptively simple: two or three sides are stitched together with one or two top handles, which are designed for shoulder or crossbody carry.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Its simplicity, however, is exactly what makes it ideal for just about any errand: Made from <strong>cotton</strong>, <strong>leather, canvas</strong>, or even <strong>nylon</strong>, its unstructured, expandable shape offers a foolproof option for those with lots to schlep. In the right size and in the right material (ideally with an inner pocket or two), a tote bag can make carrying cumbersome contents across town — like groceries and running shoes — that much easier.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We know that a tote can look pretty online, but the real test is if it can survive the true wear and tear of everyday life. So we commuted, traveled, and camped on the beach to see which totes truly held up their promises and which let us down. After testing the totes over a few months to a few years, we graded them on their <strong>storage, organization, comfort</strong>, and <strong>durability</strong>. Here are the totes that performed best in our <strong>real-world testing</strong>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-baggu-horizontal-duck-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Baggu Horizontal Duck Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=baggu-horizontal-duck-bag style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tymNylaHAbVCRfhURvPSypzk5aY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/baggu-horizontal-duck-bag-9a50fc546d5b45a28caf6b383b149de2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Baggu</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The long, adjustable strap — which can be worn over the shoulder or as a crossbody — stays in place, and the top interior pocket keeps keys and cards close at hand.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It could use another pocket or two.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a roomy, <strong>laptop-friendly interior</strong>, an <strong>adjustable shoulder strap</strong>, <strong>zippered interior pocket</strong>, and under-$40 price tag, Baggu’s duck bag has become our go-to tote for work, school, and everything in between. The canvas is <strong>lightweight</strong> yet substantial (ideal for carrying heavy books and groceries), and the lightly structured shape keeps items <strong>organized </strong>and secure when on the go. And while tote bag straps tend to slide off of our shoulders — especially when wearing a thick winter coat — the Duck Bag’s adjustable <strong>crossbody strap</strong> stays put. Plus, because it’s made from <strong>easy-to-clean cotton</strong>, ours has withstood dozens of washes (and stood up to several stains) in the washing machine. Even after years of daily use, it still looks new, making it possible to carry our laptops, full-size water bottles, books, medications, and snacks without a problem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>11 |<strong> Material:</strong> Recycled cotton canvas | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Top handles, adjustable crossbody strap | <strong>Closure:</strong> Button</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-baggu-standard-baggu-nylon-ripstop-tote></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Baggu Nylon Ripstop Tote</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Baggu Standard Baggu Nylon Ripstop Tote" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4-_MRCO7InzgkyjZcAyLPuroqQM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BagguStandardBagguNylonRipstopTote-f01dbad35e84467bac77d5326d31d32b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Baggu</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>BAGGU’s reusable bags are lightweight and virtually indestructible.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The straps slide down your shoulder.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps the most ubiquitous tote on this list, Baggu’s under-$15 nylon bags are ideal for carrying items you wouldn’t necessarily want in your purse, like fresh produce, sandy beach gear, or dirty running shoes. They’re <strong>machine washable</strong> and <strong>lightweight</strong> — and even fold up into an accompanying <strong>carrying pouch</strong> — making them exceptionally easy to throw into your car or suitcase. And unlike most totes on this list, the in-stock prints and colorways are vast: Baggu releases new patterns every season, like trippy checkerboard, nautical stripes, and bright florals, plus extra-large and mini sizes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s worth noting that the bag was modeled after a standard take-out bag, which, while charming, is also the Baggu’s greatest downfall. The short, <strong>thick straps</strong> and lack of structure will have it sliding down your arm, especially when wearing bulky layers. If you’re going to be carrying your items long distances, you’re better off with a traditional tote bag, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Baggu Horizonal Duck Bag.</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>50+ | <strong>Material:</strong> Ripstop nylon | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Top handles | <strong>Closure:</strong> Open</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-freja-new-york-lafayette-tote-cappuccino></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Freja New York Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Freja New York Lafayette Tote Cappuccino" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6GCVO7vt7KZ__A61l68-ra7QQCM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/freja-new-york-lafayette-tote-cappuccino-c8f500c6aff949c3912507e76132636c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Verishop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The vegan leather looks and feels real, and it’s generously sized.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Given the size, it could use an interior divider to keep contents more organized.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re in the market for something more polished than a canvas shopper, genuine and vegan leather totes are more durable than cotton, meaning they can hold up for decades with proper care. The only problem with leather bags, however, is that they can often feel heavy — especially for those who walk or take the subway to work. But according to InStyle Former Senior Fashion Commerce Editor Chloe Anello, that isn’t the case with Freja’s generously-sized NY Lafayette tote.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s made from a <strong>lightweight vegan leather</strong> — the “best looking (and feeling) faux leather I’ve ever seen,” she says — that never feels “far too heavy” when full. It holds “everything” she needs for work, including a <strong>16-inch laptop</strong>, various chargers, and a water bottle, and even has a <strong>double magnetic snap closure</strong> that stays put while on the move. When you consider the <strong>four interior pockets</strong> and detachable <strong>key leash</strong> (and the five luxe colorways), we think it’s a worthy splurge.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>5&nbsp;| <strong>Material: </strong>PU leather | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Top handles | <strong>Closure:</strong> Magnetic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-canvas-utility-canvas-mini-field-tote></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Canvas</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Utility Canvas Mini Field Tote</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Utility Canvas Mini Field Tote" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PBliHrdpmL_hQ6-DLyLHxCgdIqM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/utility-canvas-mini-field-tote-aa499117af11400893fb7f785595b7f7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Utility Canvas</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The structured bottom and interior pockets keep contents organized.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It doesn’t have a crossbody strap.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we set out to find the very best canvas tote bag, we had very strict criteria in mind; It needed to have a structured bottom, inside pockets, long-ish straps, and some sort of closure to keep contents secure and organized. It also — we hoped — wouldn’t be exorbitantly priced, given that canvas totes are so often free. When we asked Hayley Cavagnolo, interior designer and founder of petites clothing line Hayley Bridget, about her work bag, it was clear Utility Canvas’s Mini Field Bag really couldn’t be beat.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s my go-to everyday tote. People stop me on the street to ask me about or compliment on the bag,” Cavagnolo says. Despite the “Mini” in its name, it’s the “perfect size for my laptop, lunch, and coffee mug,” she assures, while the <strong>side pockets</strong> are “super useful” for keeping essentials close at hand. It’s made in the US from durable 18-ounce cotton canvas, which is <strong>easy to clean</strong> and <strong>durable</strong> enough for heavy use. (For reference, the BAGGU Duck Bag is made from 16 ounce cotton canvas.)&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The thin, rounded straps are long enough to stay put, and the <strong>structured bottom</strong> keeps items in place, meaning you won’t have to dig around to find your wallet, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>credit card holder</a>, or keys. Its one and only flaw is that it lacks a detachable crossbody strap — which is why we gave first place to the Duck Bag — but it does tick all of the other boxes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>4&nbsp;| <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton canvas | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Top handles | <strong>Closure:</strong> Snap</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-extra-large-llbean-boat-and-tote-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Extra Large</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L.L.Bean Boat and Tote Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L.L.Bean Boat and Tote Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sMPs8WBtCHj2Gd0hO8CmKVH3E9I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ll-bean-boat-and-tote--a4fc595a8e1743d882a374c92e75ebfb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>L.L.

Bean’s virtually indestructible Boat & Totes were carried by just about every coastal New Englander. “My parents have been using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>L.L. Bean totes</a> since before I was born,” says Gracie Wiener, who runs @<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>ironicboatandtote</a>, an Instagram dedicated to ironically monogrammed Boat & Totes. “They are the most <strong>durable</strong> bags in the world, they’ll outlive all of us.” Wiener owns several, including the extra-large size, which, she recently found out on a post office run, can hold 10 medium-sized packages.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were excited to test the hype for ourselves and learned first-hand that all the rumors were true. We've taken it everywhere from the office to the beach to long weekend camping trips. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">zipped version</a> even gave us some security, knowing things wouldn't topple out even as we bent over to pick up our kid's fallen items off the floor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All sizes come in <strong>two handle lengths</strong>, though Wiener prefers the longer straps for more versatile carrying and the medium size for everyday wear. But if you have some serious stuff to schlep, the <strong>extra-large</strong>, which measures 17 inches high, 19 inches wide, and 10 inches deep, can fit just about any cumbersome item. (While moving, we once fit two table lamps into the bag with room to spare.)&nbsp;And of course, it wouldn't be an iconic L.L. Bean tote if it weren't for their <strong>monogramming</strong> capabilities. While we do wish it came with a few more zipped compartments for keys, phones, and wallets, it hasn't been a deal-breaker for us so far.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>10&nbsp;| <strong>Material:</strong> Cotton canvas | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Top handles | <strong>Closure:</strong> Open or zip</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leather-madewell-the-zip-top-medium-transport-tote></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Transport Tote</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell The Zip-Top Medium Transport Tote" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/y24z253iJGc7D09DHt108usgwAA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-the-zip-top-medium-transport-tote-52a7d1651c3247af82cbf6ecc28f8b49.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The durable leather can last decades.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It can feel heavy when full.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Is there a more popular tote than this Transport Tote from Madewell? After schlepping it around town, to the office, and on trips, we understood why it's amassed such a cult-like following. To start, the <strong>size is just perfect</strong>, comfortably fitting books, water bottles, and laptops without completely getting lost in a black hole. Next, the few <strong>compartments</strong> allowed us to keep our wallets, phones, headphones, and chapstick easy to grab.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve had this bag for nearly a decade now, and while I can’t say it looks brand new — it definitely looks worn in — it has held up over the year, even through a substantial amount of abuse,” says Anello of this no-frills <strong>leather</strong> tote, one of the brand’s longtime bestsellers. The <strong>zippered closure</strong> has made it excellent for travel, although it did tend to get heavy when overfilled, she notes. Using the recommended <strong>crossbody straps</strong> allowed us to shift the weight around more comfortably.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>3&nbsp;| <strong>Material:</strong> Leather | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Top handles | <strong>Closure:</strong> Zipper</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-designer-coach-rae-tote-in-colorblock></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Designer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Coach Rae Tote in Colorblock</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Coach Rae Tote in Colorblock" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/S5WeHsLX1_vAxr7o9Qp82hjY6eE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/coach-rae-tote-in-colorblock-5031d0e2849041cdade7d42061f2abac.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Coach</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes with a detachable zippered pouch.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>You can't zip it closed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We recently had a guided tour through the Coach store, and found<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> all the best bags and shoes</a> worth splurging on. One of those items was this Rae tote, which immediately stood out for its <strong>superior leather</strong>, size, and design. There weren't many compartments inside, but it did come with a <strong>removable zipped pouch</strong> for you to store any creams or essentials in. The tote itself was <strong>extremely spacious</strong> as well. We were convinced you could easily stuff spare shoes, sweaters, books, laptops, and more in. Does that make it a little heavy in combination with the substantial leather? Yes, but it does have an <strong>extra long shoulder strap</strong> to spare your hands. And while we always appreciate a zip top for extra security, we recognize that would change the aesthetics of this bag. All in all, we simply fell in love with how luxurious this bag looked and felt. It will withstand the test of time and remain a classic piece to own forever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>4&nbsp;| <strong>Material: </strong>Glovetanned leather | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Top handles, shoulder straps | <strong>Closure:</strong> Open</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mini-everlane-the-italian-leather-mini-studio-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mini</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Italian Leather Mini Studio Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Italian Leather Mini Studio Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BpmEZwq9Y6Y7FHunq0ktKUZkQzg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-italian-leather-mini-studio-bag-dec853a552cf418e9138d9ff2c4f03d4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s<strong> </strong>small yet functional, and the crossbody strap is comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The suede lining is difficult to clean.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Madewell's Transport tote</a>, Everlane's leather tote is basically the same thing — but <strong>mini</strong> and zip-less. This teeny bag didn't fit a ton, but for those days out when we didn't need to bring a laptop or a big water bottle, it was ideal. The tote still fit a good book and a journal, making it much <strong>more useful than a standard purse</strong>. With one inside pocket and one outside, we could easily <strong>compartmentalize</strong> our items and ensure our phones stayed within reach. And while it doesn't have a zip closure, it does have a single button to at least keep the top semi-closed. We also liked the <strong>canvas shoulder strap</strong>, as it felt durable and <strong>comfortable</strong> to use as compared to a leather strap.

The exterior is made of <strong>terrycloth fabric</strong>, not unlike your beach towel, while the interior features an easy-to-clean, <strong>wipeable polyester</strong> fabric, so we never had to worry much about spills ruining the bag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most notably, there were <strong>straps to carry our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>beach hat</a></strong> on the exterior (!!). As hat girlies ourselves, we can't express how convenient it was not to have to distort our hats and stuff them into our bags when we didn't want to wear them. It completely changed the game in traveling with hats. And of course, there was <strong>plenty of room</strong> in this tote for towels, water bottles, books, and more. Our biggest fear is losing our keys or phone at the beach, so thankfully, the <strong>zippered compartment</strong> allowed us to secure our valuables. The only con truly is that we couldn't zip the top closed, which could have added a layer of security.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>1&nbsp;| <strong>Material: </strong>Terrycloth | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Shoulder straps | <strong>Closure:</strong> Open</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-bis-the-east-to-west-tote></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Travel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Béis East To West Tote</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="B&amp;eacute;is The East To West Tote" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/aXKCEvIo60D1EaTtE5gRQotPOT4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/beis-the-east-to-west-tote-575863be62d3464eadc32bff9cb1dd2f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Beis</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There's a compartment for just about everything.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The top zip doesn't close all the way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Two things that are always lacking during travel: time and luggage space. Beis understood this obstacle and created the perfect bag designed to save you a little bit of both. It's compartment galore in this tote -- there are <strong>pockets for your laptop</strong>, passport, water bottle, phone, and even a <strong>key-strap</strong> on the exterior zipped pocket. You won't be caught rummaging around to find your documents and papers as you're rushed through security -- everything is exactly there where you put it. On top of that, each compartment is <strong>padded</strong>, so valuables are protected from any kind of pushing and shoving as well.

We felt comfortable being able to protect everything with the <strong>zippered closure</strong>, although we're not completely sure why it doesn't close all the way.

It’s not cheap, but it certainly isn’t lacking in features; The tote has a total of <strong>seven pockets</strong>, two sets of straps, an interior<strong> keyring</strong>, and a neoprene <strong>water bottle holder</strong>, making it by far the most sophisticated canvas tote on this list. And while some might prefer a leather tote for work, we find canvas totes <strong>lighter</strong> and easier to maneuver when commuting, especially when taking the subway or bus. The <strong>large size</strong> can comfortably accommodate a 16-inch laptop and is spacious enough to even be used as a <strong>weekender</strong> or carry-on. (Though if you don’t have much to pack, the small will fit a 13-inch laptop.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were particularly impressed by the <strong>shoulder straps</strong>, which are a touch thicker and longer — and therefore easier to wear — than those on most totes, and the <strong>weight felt distributed</strong> evenly when full. Most surprising, however, was the bottom of the bag, which appeared to be treated with a <strong>dirt-resistant coating</strong> — an excellent feature for city commuters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>3&nbsp;| <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton canvas | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Top handles | <strong>Closure:</strong> Open</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-a-zipper-longchamp-large-le-pliage-tote></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best with a Zipper</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Longchamp Le Pliage Tote</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Longchamp Le Pliage Large Shoulder Tote Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/V6UW6pprQ8q0D7lRCZ7OmwVtz_U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/longchamp-le-pliage-large-shoulder-tote-bag-95b53910c3514f7497ee7ddd6d311ae6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s roomy, lightweight, and can be packed up for easy carrying.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The straps aren’t adjustable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The runner-up to our best travel tote, Longchamp’s long-beloved Pliage tote is a classic for a reason. It’s <strong>roomy </strong>enough to use as a carry-on (and <strong>fits perfectly under the seat</strong> in front of you, as we found out during our travels), it <strong>folds flat</strong> with both a <strong>snap and zippered closure</strong>, and even has a <strong>water-resistant lining</strong> to combat spills. Made from <strong>durable nylon</strong> and <strong>embossed leather</strong> — both of which are easy to clean — Longchamp’s totes can last decades even with everyday wear. (A friend of ours new-looking Pliage tote, we recently found out, is actually her mom’s from the ‘90s.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The bag holds up very well, in part due to its sturdy <strong>YKK zippers</strong>: each one is finished with leather tabs to ensure longevity and <strong>seal out moisture</strong>. We did find however that the single side pocket in the interior wasn't big enough to hold the larger iPhone versions. It was only good enough for keys and credits cards. It also lacks any kind of adjustable straps. You’re stuck with two (albeit long) shoulder straps, which may or may not slide down your shoulder.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>7<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, leather | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Top handles | <strong>Closure:</strong> Zipper, snap</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-convertible-polne-cyme-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Convertible</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Polène Cyme Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pol&amp;egrave;ne Cyme Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/thWlHTDOS2DAdGnQH_7F7haXlJ4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/polne-cyme-bag-f0a6ab491eec4997bde08b68f1f67952.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>PolÃ¨ne</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It can be worn in multiple ways and comes with a removable pouch.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The straps can dig into the shoulders when the bag is filled to the brim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There hasn't been a trip, an office day, or a plane ride spent without this tote ever since it came into our possession. While its beautiful design and <strong>luxurious leather</strong> are big contributing factors to why, it's also its <strong>convenient size</strong> and <strong>convertibility</strong> that's made it such a hit for us. The two ends can be folded inward and clasped closed through a magnet, compressing its size and making it more friendly for daily use. The top handle and shoulder straps also offered multiple ways we could carry the bag. Laptops, notebooks, sweaters, and more fit into its big open space with ease, and any little miscellaneous items were placed in the <strong>removable pouch</strong> that came with the bag. Despite being made of substantial leather, the bag itself <strong>does not feel heavy</strong>. That being said, where there's a ton in the bag, the thin leather straps can feel like they're digging into the shoulders slightly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>7&nbsp;| <strong>Material: </strong>Calf leather | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Top handles, shoulder straps | <strong>Closure:</strong> Magnetic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-straw-terrain-leather-handle-market-tote></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Straw</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Terrain Terrain Leather Market Tote</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anthropologie Terrain Leather Handle Market Tote" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bbVokE4srogvoVsXeXs8oJbgTMQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anthropologie-terrain-leather-handle-market-tote-8fd618a04e40459fb9fcf6cf8b27e962.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The leather handle will be more comfortable to hold than straw.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It won't be easy to clean, especially if you get sand in it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the summer or beachy vacation, we recommend adding a straw tote bag into the mix. We named this our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best straw bag</a> before, thanks to its versatility and high-quality construction. With a <strong>leather handle</strong>, instead of straw, the tote looks more elevated than a traditional bag, and it will also be more comfortable to hold, especially when filled with necessities. <strong>Hand-woven in Morocco</strong> from date palm leaves, the bag is also <strong>sustainable</strong>, giving us an even better feeling about this back. We love how on top of being functional, it also looks particularly stylish. It will make a welcome addition to any vacation look. But to clean it, you need to hand wash it with the tiniest bit of vinegar and reshape it clean, which might be a pain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>1&nbsp;| <strong>Material: </strong>Palm, leather | <strong>Straps and Handles:</strong> Top handles | <strong>Closure:</strong> Open</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For this tested story, we tapped into our rich internal source of style experts and received recommendations based on long-term first-hand experiences to find the best tote bags.

Before purchasing a bag, examine the straps to ensure the stitching is high quality and secure — i.e. the straps won't break when you've loaded your tote to the brim. The wider the straps, the better they distribute weight, so look for totes with <strong>wide straps</strong> if you don't want them digging into your shoulders. For extra versatility, look for totes with <strong>adjustable straps</strong> and/or <strong>detachable</strong> ones to wear crossbody.

Generally, <strong>leather</strong> and <strong>canvas</strong> are the <strong>most durable</strong>, and can withstand several years (if not decades) with proper care. Of the two, canvas totes are <strong>easier to repair</strong> should the bag become ripped, stained, or torn.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you wash a tote bag?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No matter the material, it’s best to first check the care tag on your tote before washing.
