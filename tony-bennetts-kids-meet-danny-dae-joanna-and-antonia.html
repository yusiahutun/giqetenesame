The legendary performer was the proud father of his four kids, Danny, Dae, Joanna and Antonia.&nbsp;</span>Tony’s death was announced on July 21, 2023, after battling Alzheimer’s.</p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Tony Bennett, born Anthony Dominick Benedetto in Astoria, Queens, on August 3rd, 1926, has passed away in his hometown of New York City at the age of 96 earlier today,” his rep said in a statement. “The beloved singer, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 2016, is survived by his wife, Susan Benedetto, his two sons, Danny and Dae Bennett, his daughters Johanna Bennett and Antonia Bennett and nine grandchildren.”&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Tony first experienced fatherhood during his marriage with his first wife,&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Patricia Beech</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>. The “Way You Look Tonight” singer married Patricia in 1952, and less than three years later, their eldest son, Danny, was born. They later welcomed son Dae, but Tony and Patricia called it quits in 1971.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>That same year, the iconic crooner walked down the aisle with his second wife,&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Sandra Grant Bennett</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>. Tony and Sandra were together for more than eight years, but they officially separated in 1987. Their divorce wasn’t finalized until 2007, according to reports. Despite the messy split, the former duo had two daughters, Joanna and Antonia.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>As a father of four, Tony had his hands full while juggling his career as a singer, painter and author. The “I Left My Heart in San Francisco” artist also remarried for the third time with spouse</span><a class=x_ContentPasted0 href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=4>&nbsp;</a><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Susan Benedetto</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;(neé Crow) in 2007, though the lovebirds held off from having any children together. Instead, Susan has become a stepmom to his kids.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Considering their dad was one of music’s most beloved singers for several decades, it’s no surprise that Danny, Dae, Joanna and Antonia followed in their father’s famous footsteps. While each of his kids has pursued careers in music and Hollywood, Tony said he adopted his love from showbiz from his own father.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“He would sit on the stairs and sing opera, show music and pop hits to my brother and me in a fine, clear voice. I like to think you can still hear my father’s voice in me. I know I do,” Tony recalled</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;in 2017. “My father was the man everyone in our family, and even in our neighborhood, sought out for advice because he would listen, treat the other person with respect and try to reply with sympathy.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In February 2021, Tony’s family opened up about his Alzheimer’s diagnosis. He was first diagnosed with the disease in 2016 and continued to perform until the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Danny and Susan joined Tony in the</span><a class=x_ContentPasted0 href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable data-linkindex=5>&nbsp;</a><u><i>AARP</i></u><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;interview where they shared the news of his diagnosis with the world. Even in Tony’s final days, music remained a constant in his life.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“There’s a lot about him that I miss. Because he’s not the old Tony anymore. But when he sings, he’s the old Tony,” Susan said.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tpqexXZeyr7rErausZZuesbR5zJ6crWWUlruvxYydmJ5lmqSur7rAZpinnF2Wu7W7zaKYaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
