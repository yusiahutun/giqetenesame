"I didn’t want to spend a lot of money, so I went and got me some spray paint. I was spray painting this old, 1968 Ford Ranger one-ton dump truck. I called up Toby, because he’s always laughing at these phrases I come up with. I was always impressed with Steve Earle [who] had this phrase called ‘Dog House Roses,’ which is roses you bring home if you’re in the dog house. So I always try to come up with those phrases. I called Toby up and said, ‘I got a new one: Rattle Can Red.’ He laughed and got a kick out of it. About 30 days later I came up with [the opening verse]."</p><p>"I had a hand-me-down ride painted rattle-can red / Secondhand tires with poor-boy tread / Made a lot of almost-love in the bed of that truck / That got stuck a lot," he wrote in the opening lyrics.</p><p>"I brought the whole verse to him and he loved it," Pinson remembers. "We’ll do that a lot … he’ll start a verse and save it or it will still be around when I get there. We’ve just had a relationship so long that we kind of know what sounds like the other guy, so we’ll make sure those songs are still around when we get back together. I took it to him, and we just love that song."</p><p>"And we spent what little money we had / On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas / Go get your girl, go make the drag / If you're lucky, you can take 'er 'cross the railroad tracks / Where the man in the moon works his magic / On the second runner-up of the 4-H pageant / Seems like yesterday even though / That was fourteen hundred and fifty-two beers ago," they wrote in the first of the three evolving 'Beers Ago' choruses.</p><p>"It’s just a really cool song about remembering things that were a long time ago that just seemed like yesterday," explains Pinson. "That’s something you do every day. [The song] has a really cool groove, and it’s one of my favorite tracks on [Toby's] record."</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Listen to Toby Keith, 'Beers Ago'</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmraeSrnqsscitn2aalZq%2FtHnAoKZmpKmntqS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
