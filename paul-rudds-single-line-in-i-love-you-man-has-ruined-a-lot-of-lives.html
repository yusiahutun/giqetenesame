He’s provided us endless laughs over the years, but there’s one line that’s ‘ruined lives’.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actor, who works at <a href=#>his sweet shop</a> in his spare time, came onto the scene almost three decades ago in the 1995 hit movie, Clueless.&nbsp;To this day it remains one of his best-known, but the line that ‘ruined lives’ was actually in the 2009 <a href=#>movie</a>, I Love You, Man.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1203470663-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-paul-rudd-on-his-line-that-ruined-bass-players-lives>Paul Rudd on his line that ‘ruined bass players lives’</h2><p>While they were shooting the movie, the band Rush just coincidentally happened to be in LA on tour, the actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> GQ.</p><p>“They said all right yeah, we can come by and we’ll shoot a scene,” which was incredible as it was part of the storyline.</p><p>But, the iconic line “SLAP THE BASS,” was born with Rudd’s character, Peter Klaven, and became iconic for hardcore fans. Although he hears it less now than he did at one point in his life, the actor said it’s the line he heard more than any other when he was walking down the street.</p><p>“I know I’ve met a few bass players in my life who want to strangle me,” the 54-year-old joked. “‘Like dude, you ruined my life. That f****** joke’.”</p><p>Rudd starred alongside Jason Segel, who played Sydney Fife in the film, and the chemistry was undeniable. In fact, the pair had met and worked together before on Knocked Up.</p><p>“It was just like a buddy film but in the structure of a romantic comedy,” he gushed. “It was so much fun doing that movie and there was such a joyous feel on it. I think because Jason and I could complete each other’s sentences.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-85290381-1024x782.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-actor-isn-t-stopping-anytime-soon>The actor isn’t stopping anytime soon</h2><p>Despite a highly successful thirty-year career, the star isn’t looking like he’s going to be slowing down anytime soon.</p><p>His latest venture is playing Mr. Gary Grooberson in 2024’s Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, which was recently released in theaters.</p><p>However, the star did recently say seeing his face plastered across billboards all over the world has made him ‘self-conscious’.</p><p>In an interview with Chris Moyles on Radio X, the 54-year-old was asked “Do you ever walk past a billboard with your face on it and double take and go ”oh God, that is me?”</p><p>“I usually drive by and go ‘urgh’. I get very self-conscious about seeing my face plastered everywhere.”</p><p>Well, at least he gets to look at the face that hasn’t aged a day!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2eEcLzArqNmqqWZsbR50qKloKSVYrmqusRmoKdlmWK5sMLEZrCorV2irq95x5qqZqqlnrumsIyaZKWnpGK8p3nLoq2eq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
