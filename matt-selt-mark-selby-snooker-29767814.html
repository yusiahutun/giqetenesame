Selt had gone 43-0 up in the 17th frame, but he was 9-7 down on frames when his sweary outburst was picked up by the official.</p><p>Tatiana was quick to nip the X-rated language in the bud, and she warned the Englishman: "I have to warn you for swearing, if I have to warn you again you will lose the frame."</p><p><b>READ MORE:</b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#> <b>Meet Desislava Bozhilova - the no-nonsense snooker ref keeping order at the Crucible</b></a></p><p>Selby ran out the eventual winner 10-8 - and Selt was gracious in defeat: "He potted some unbelievably great balls in that last break and he was a worthy winner."</p><p>Selby then added, when asked how he was feeling at the World Championship: "The last month or so I feel like I’ve been playing better, happy with where my game’s at.
