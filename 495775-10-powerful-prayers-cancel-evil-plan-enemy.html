You have shown us that everything will be alright if we trust in your way. Oh dear God, I come kneeling before you today, putting my family before you. You have blessed me with the kindest father and the most hardworking mother. For that alone, you deserve to receive eternal praise from me. Dear Lord, you have blessed me with the most caring sister and a loving and protecting brother. Our family has always been together. Oh, my father, I am praying for each member of my family that you may guide them in their day-to-day lives. Bless my father, so his business can expand, bless my mother so she can succeed in her career, and bless my sibling in whichever path they choose. Watch over them, guide them on the right path, and bless them daily. Abba father, I do not take it for granted that you have blessed me with one big and happy family. I am forever indebted that you made me a member of this family. Every generation in my family has been blessed, and I pray that you sanctify future generations. May our elders transfer their wisdom and humility to the young ones. I pray for my grandparents, uncles, aunties, cousins, nephews, and nieces. This world is full of chaos, and I ask you, God, that you may shield each person in my family from the turmoil. I pray you to assign a guardian angel who will be with us through the days and nights. I am rebuking any evil plan by the enemy, that God, you may send away any malicious plans that the devil may be thinking of. Thank you, God, for being a wonderful and fair God.

We enjoy the harmony in this family and love each other as we love you. Oh, father, I come before tonight, bringing forth my family. I pray for everyone I consider my family, those we are related to by blood, and those who are family because of our spiritual journeys. I condemn any evil plans by the enemy to break us apart. We have been working as one family, and I pray we keep working together until the last day. Help me fight this enemy, my dear God. Send every weapon I need to defeat the people that make me lose sleep. I am offering my prayer to your altar, knowing that you will respond to every request I have mentioned in this prayer.
