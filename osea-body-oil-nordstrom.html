Many body oils feel a bit too greasy, and lotions can feel slimy or suffocatingly thick, and none of that is welcome on sweltering summer days. Avoiding these common product pitfalls is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">one silky $48 oil</a> favored by Nordstrom shoppers, who use it to revive dull, dehydrated skin, fade stretch marks, and so much more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">Osea's Undaria Algae Body Oil</a> isn't like the others you may have tried once and left to accumulate dust. As multiple reviewers confirm, the lightweight oil soaks in quickly, so you won't have to do an awkward dance in the bathroom to help it dry before getting dressed or stress about getting it all over your sheets at bedtime. And its quick absorption is just one perk.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop Now:</strong> $48, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">nordstrom.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Courtesy of a 10-oil mixture and undaria seaweed (or algae), reviewers say the blend soothes dryness, reduces the appearance of stretch marks, and induces a soft glow. The algae is steeped for six months in the oil to produce a higher concentration of minerals and antioxidants. For additional moisture, one reviewer who lives in a drier climate suggested adding a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">pump or two of the oil</a> to your favorite lotion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While you may have heard the myth that oils aren't moisturizing (or can cause breakouts), Dr. Shari Marchbein previously explained to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle</a> that "oils can help to both hydrate and soften the skin," even if you're typically prone to acne. They're also capable of seeping in more deeply than lotions. Osea is no different, and to get the most benefit from it, slather it on after a bath or shower.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to using the oil as an antidote to current skin concerns, some shoppers employ it as a preventative measure. "After trying an overhyped belly oil for my growing pregnancy belly, I turned to the Osea body oil and body balm," wrote one. "I had started to get stretch marks and the oil and balm combo have nearly gotten rid of them!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another pregnant reviewer even prefers Osea to Bio-Oil, a long-held customer favorite. "I've supplemented (more like replaced) my Bio-Oil with this body oil and honestly, this is FAR superior in smell and feel. I love that it comes in a glass bottle AND has a pump!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it may be a skincare splurge at $48, many reviewers emphasized that it's a worthy investment. Some are even on their third and fourth bottles, which they attest can really last.
