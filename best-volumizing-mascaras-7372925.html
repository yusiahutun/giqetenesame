Despite the expansive selection of mascaras out there, few formula types hold as much appeal as a volumizing mascara. They provide the look of false lashes but without the effort (or the glue), creating dense and dramatic lashes that are epically long and flush with inky pigment to make maximum impact with just one swipe (although more is more, we say).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-loral-paris-voluminous-waterproof-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Oréal Paris Voluminous Waterproof Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon L'Or&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;al Voluminous Volume Building Waterproof Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Ycyvjku8ntC_QENSoWxMnoX5aAM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loral-voluminous-volume-building-waterproof-mascara-926c781b6aec44329c2bb3a7ef3d3e8d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This iconic mascara stands the test of time and comes in a variety of sultry shades.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The formula can be stubborn and hard to remove.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though it’s been around for years, L’Oréal Voluminous is still one of the very best volumizing mascaras ever to hit the market. While it won’t create super-lengthy lashes, it’s an outstanding option for those who want an incredibly thick, fluttery, and bold look. We’ve used it on and off for at least 15 years and are always pleasantly surprised by how great it is whenever it makes it back into our rotation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond just beyond the dramatic look it offers, this mascara has a lot going for it —&nbsp;the price, the broad selection of color options, and the fact that it comes in both traditional and waterproof formulas. “It’s a cult favorite mascara of mine,” says Neil Scibelli, a celebrity makeup artist. “I've used the waterproof formula on a range of projects from stage to red carpet, and it really is an amazing, affordable option for a volumizing, dramatic look.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It can be challenging to remove the formula, so we’d highly recommend using an oil-based makeup remover, which will help break it down and best rinse it away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>8｜<strong>Size:</strong> 0.27 fl oz｜<strong>Waterproof: </strong>Available in waterproof and traditional formulas</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-essence-cosmetics-lash-princess-false-lash-effect-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Essence Cosmetics Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Essence Cosmetics Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vh0-CrU-LV76q0WIFj1A5wxPrmI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/essence-cosmetics-lash-princess-false-lash-effect-mascara-abe9395f30f44c26bafa450e7b0294ea.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> If you love a dreamy, fluttery, full lash, this mascara is for you.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This one can flake on oily lids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is one of our all-time favorite mascaras thanks to its extremely wallet-friendly price point, tapered brush (it’s great at grabbing little lashes), and wow-factor finish. The formula creates a wide-eyed Bambi-like look that’s flirty and feminine with just a few swipes of the wand. Plus, it's available in a waterproof version, which is especially key for anyone looking for high impact lashes that last all day long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although if you’re prone to flaking, this one may leave some fallout behind, especially if your eyelids run oily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>1｜<strong>Size:</strong> 0.304 fl oz｜<strong>Waterproof: </strong>Available in waterproof and traditional formulas</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-chanel-le-volume-rvolution-de-chanel-extreme-volume-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Chanel Extreme Volume Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Chanel Le Volume R&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;volution de Chanel Extreme Volume Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2nIlyb3tIvAudxGQ6ytEgJo7XNY=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Chanel-Le-Volume-Revolution-de-Chanel-Extreme-Volume-Mascara-4d7dd77df9324514bf5d8372a9c659a7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chanel</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> In addition to providing fantastic volume, this formula delivered impressive lift and definition.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> A lot of product can build up in the brush, so proceed with caution if you have ultra-fine lashes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When picking out products from Chanel, we don’t call it buying, we call it investing, and while this mascara is worth the splurge. Its patented 3D printed brush features a honeycomb-like design with little reservoirs that hold the formula into the brush to deposit it along the lashes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we could see how all that mascara may create too much bulk on super-fine lashes with an initial swipe (if that sounds like you, consider wiping down the brush before applying), we experienced the total opposite.&nbsp;It laid on a perfect amount of mascara without chunking up, coating each lash with opaque black pigment that looked smooth and soft, like our natural lashes. We added several coats and still never experienced any clumps. Yet, as impressive as the volume was, we were most wowed by the formula’s lift. After a full day of wear, our lashes still looked as curled and flirty as they did when we’d applied it in the morning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>1｜<strong>Size:</strong> 0.21 fl oz｜<strong>Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-neutrogena-hydro-boost-plumping-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena Hydro Boost Plumping Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena Hydro Boost Plumping Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hDVzCli89mbhubf5HlEWyZhsmK0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/walgreens-neutrogena-hydro-boost-plumping-mascara-3ed4b7fcd58249b0a8ff191c2aade2b3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walgreens</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This affordable formula is actually good for your lashes.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You won’t get insane volume from this one, but it’s great for an everyday plush look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you might not always associate this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>drugstore brand with mascara</a>, Scibelli swears by this formula, who’s adored and worked with it for years. “This one features hyaluronic acid in the formula, which plumps and volumizes the lashes, along with keratin and vitamin E, which helps to strengthen and nourish at the same time,” he says. “This is a great option for someone who likes a glossier formula but still wants that volume!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The volume may be a bit subtle for those who like really bold, high-impact volume, but we think it’s very satisfying for a daily volumizing mascara.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>2｜<strong>Size:</strong> 0.21 fl oz｜<strong>Waterproof: </strong>Available in waterproof and traditional formulas</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lengthening-kevyn-aucoin-indecent-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lengthening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kevyn Aucoin Indecent Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kevyn Aucoin Indecent Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MHWCenhe4NsXimq9yZaL9Yn1PJc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kevyn-Aucoin-Indecent-Mascara-5e2c659295c644d1bb9f086a4d60b767.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kevyn Aucoin</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The creamy formula creates a really lengthy and dense-looking lash.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The brush holds a lot of product, so be careful during application.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The iconic makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin’s masterful work lives on through his brand’s products, which pros and amateurs alike use with his helpful techniques, including celebrity makeup artist, Natalia Thomas, who has worked with stars like Zazie Beetz and Karlie Kloss. While many people apply mascara the same way every time, Thomas customizes her application for each formula, including this one, which creates a full yet lightweight and lengthy lash.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Thomas, you should first apply this mascara directly to the areas where you want more length and volume. “Starting where you’d like to build volume means that the wand delivers a heavier application of product to the areas you’d like to create more density,” she explains. “Don’t be afraid to add more coats until you get the look you’d like.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because the brush can hold a lot of product, those who are wary of a super-plump look or are less experienced makeup users may want to wipe off excess first.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>1｜<strong>Size:</strong> .34 fl oz｜<strong>Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-waterproof-too-faced-better-than-sex-waterproof-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Waterproof</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Too Faced Better Than Sex Waterproof Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9iHRXusfAWpQiSjToWWe_RnSVzw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sephora-too-faced-better-than-sex-waterproof-mascara-284454bd8097491bad621aebddfd567f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This mascara delivers the same “hot damn!” results as the OG formula.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The waterproof formula is not quite as smooth as the original.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For many, Better Than Sex is the be-all, end-all of volumizing mascaras. “It’s a total favorite and really holds up to its reputation,” says Scibelli.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This mascara's high-flying status is partly due to the chunky, hourglass-shaped wand, which grabs, coats, and practically teases lashes to create a very thick and bold lash. He adds that the formula is infused with collagen and polymers which plump the lashes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love the packaging on this waterproof version, which features fun little droplets on the tube, as well as its formula, which stands up to the OG regarding the final look. However, like most <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>waterproof mascaras</a>, the texture of the formula can be a little drier and less creamy, which may require a bit more finagling on your part to get a smoother look. Trust us, it’s still worth the buy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>1｜<strong>Size:</strong> 8 mL｜<strong>Waterproof: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curling-fenty-beauty-hella-thicc-volumizing-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Curling</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fenty Beauty Volumizing Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JkBFV625qH1JogpGBm_y6FrMaSM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Fenty-Beauty-Hella-Thicc-Volumizing-Mascara-cbc9e8a51d5d4275a0e29c42e0399aba.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The striking look this mascara can create with one swipe is sensational.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The tube could feel more luxe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This beloved mascara from Rihanna’s makeup brand is one of the best new launches we’ve tried in recent months. It didn’t take much work for the ultra-black formula and tapered, bristled brush to deliver super bold, thick lashes with serious lift —&nbsp;as in we couldn’t believe we didn’t need a lash curler to get the open-eyed look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lashes stay dramatic and soft long after application, too. The only thing that disappointed us about this mascara was the tube itself. The plastic packaging was very lightweight, and we wish it had more heft to feel more luxe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>1｜<strong>Size:</strong> 10 mL｜<strong>Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fullness-dior-diorshow-waterproof-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Fullness</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dior Diorshow Waterproof Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Diorshow Waterproof Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0ym2yC4yn_Yoep6tL-tb31NKDYw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/diorshow-waterproof-mascara-4cce61c5ff124cef89c325d4c22552a6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The brush really delivers on bold lashes, plus the color options are lovely.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This product may irritate sensitive eyes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Diorshow formula is a staple in Thomas’s kit. Though she doesn’t use the wand on clients (she uses a fresh one each time for a sanitary application), she’s a big fan when she’s using it herself. “I absolutely love the jumbo brush that really allows me to pack product into my roots and feather out the ends,” she says. “The formula contains nylon microfibers that help to build a really full lash.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">She also notes that the brown shade is a wonderful pick not just for a softer look, but on blondes and redheads, who may find a deep black mascara too severe. The only downside is that some people with sensitive eyes may find this itchy or irritating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>3｜<strong>Size:</strong> 11.5 mL｜<strong>Waterproof: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-drama-grande-cosmetics-grandedrama-intense-thickening-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best For Drama</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Grande Cosmetics Intense Thickening Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Grande Cosmetics GrandeDRAMA Intense Thickening Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lgVqAgV1KUPD0JX6VnrQomQ2jVY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/grande-cosmetics-grandedrama-intense-thickening-mascara-6471aded955e4e6ba2b1ba131ce1f3de.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The formula is infused with nourishing castor oil.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We wish the tube had more heft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want a dramatic look, you’ll get it from this Grande Cosmetics mascara —&nbsp;after all, it’s right in the name! The twisted, hourglass-shaped brush is perfect for separating and swathing each lash with plenty of pigment to create the appearance of fat, juicy lashes. Plus, the nourishing formula will help promote bolder and stronger lashes over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even better, it lasts all day without flaking or smudging, and won’t clump up on you, even after several coats. We will say that although the gilded tube looks weighty (a feature we love in a fancy mascara), it’s actually very lightweight.

The molded bristles of the sculpted wand pull the formula through the lashes to help curl, separate, and plump the lashes, while castor and argan oils help condition and strengthen. We love the spherical tip, which allows you to get up close and personal with the wand to target those teensy lashes in the inner corners of the eye.

But just a head's up: Be sure to open your tube carefully, as the wiper mechanism inside (which removes excess product from the brush as you pull it out) can stick to the inner part of the cap.

The densely-packed bristles on the curved wand saturate lashes with rich, black pigment that’s infused with lash-boosting peptides, castor oil, and panthenol. We get a false lash effect from this mascara in just a few coats without ever worrying about our lashes looking spidery. However, the hydrating ingredients and oils within the formula do also make it somewhat easy to smear if you aren't careful or have an oily lid. To avoid any sliding, we suggest reserving your application to solely the upper lashes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shades: </strong>1｜<strong>Size:</strong> 0.32 fl oz｜<strong>Waterproof: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-smudge-proof-thrive-causemetics-liquid-lash-extensions-mascara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Smudge-Proof</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Thrive Causemetics Liquid Lash Extensions Mascara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Thrive Causemetics Liquid Lash Extensions Mascara" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/e_r5O6veQmD5gojedZGsOp9tMt4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/thrive-causemetics-liquid-lash-extensions-mascara-fff565cd9bca4059867e7a8df989ba09.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Thrive Causemetics</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This mascara lasts forever on the lash and does exactly what it says,&nbsp;imparting a lash extension effect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Tubing mascaras like this one require a different application technique.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you find yourself buying mascara after mascara and being disappointed by smudging, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tubing mascara</a> may change the game for you.

If you want a super dramatic look, she recommends looking for a buildable, creamy, and slightly drier formula, which will make it easy to lay on multiple coats without looking clumpy. “I typically suggest going for a carbon black, matte formula if you're looking for a thicker, more volumized lash,” adds Scibelli.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s really only one type of mascara you want to avoid when trying to create a volumized look to your lash —&nbsp;wet ones. “A wetter formula is going to do a great job of coating every lash, but most likely won’t give a volume effect,” says Thomas.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Wand</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We find that the ideal wand for mascara is highly personal —&nbsp;some people love a traditional bristle brush while others prefer a molded wand. Thomas likes traditional brushes: “They help to separate lashes and give a feathering effect at the tips, but also hold a lot of product to be able to build the lash line,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ll want to consider the shape, too. Both Khan and Scibelli like an hourglass-shaped brush on their mascara wands. “It gives you the option of a thicker end and a slimmer side for both gripping the lash at the base as well as bumping up the lashes for volume,” says Scibelli, while Khan adds that “they’re great to help build volume and length, especially on those with sparse eyelashes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regarding the bristles themselves, look for densely-packed ones with varying lengths to hug each lash.

Khan recommends curling your lash first, which will boost the wow factor of the final look, then apply (and reapply). “I always recommend starting at the very base of the lashes to add volume, drama, and an almost eyeliner-like effect,” says Khan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thomas recommends starting at the base of the lash line and wiggling the brush slowly as you move towards the tip to completely saturate each lash. “If the formula contains cellulose fibers, the back-and-forth motion will help them to adhere to the root of your lashes and create a thicker lash line,” she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can always layer on multiple coats to get to the level of volume you love, although Khan recommends waiting a minute or two for the first coat to dry and set.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do volumizing mascaras expire?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All beauty products expire, and if a product is liquid, like mascara, it’ll expire even faster. That’s because dark places that are damp (such as, say, the inside of a tube of mascara) are perfect breeding grounds for bacteria. Our pros all recommend switching out your mascara every three months to a fresh tube. “It’s incredibly important to keep expired products away from the face, especially the eyes, as you’re more prone to infection,” warns Khan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How you use your mascara will also determine how quickly it expires. “The formula isn’t as effective after three months, once air has been introduced to the product,” explains Thomas. This means that every time you pump the wand in and out of the tube, more air gets into the formula and dries it out faster.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do volumizing mascaras work?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s no question that volumizing mascaras work —&nbsp;but as is the case with all beauty products, a mascara that’s right for your best friend may not be the right one for you.&nbsp; “Mascaras work differently depending on everyone's lash size and shape, so sometimes it's just a matter of trial and error,” says Scibelli.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To evaluate a mascara's lash-lifting effect, take a look at the ingredients. “The addition of fibers, waxes, polymers and ceramides make current volumizing mascaras a great staple to have in your makeup bag,” says Khan, while Thomas adds that its the fibers in particular that lead to a fuller look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Then, remember your application technique! “To create a volumizing look, make sure that you do a back-and-forth motion at the root before dragging upward to the tip of the lashes,” says Thomas. “Feel free to add as many coats as you like to achieve the look you’re going for.”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Orofino</a> is a freelance writer, editor, and consultant with over a decade of experience in the beauty industry.
