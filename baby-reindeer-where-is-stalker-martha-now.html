But where is she now? Here’s what we know…&nbsp;</p><p id=eXPH9-5BACK data-wc=51>Richard has kept the real name and identity of his stalker out of the press, so it is difficult to find out where ‘Martha’ is now.

But usually, it’s a prior relationship or someone you know or a work colleague. Stalking and harassment is a form of mental illness. It would have been wrong to paint her as a monster, because she’s unwell, and the system’s failed her.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd admits he 'made mistakes' with real stalker that inspired Netflix series" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/75e9bae0d6a7-donny-baby-reindeer.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd admits he 'made mistakes' with real stalker that inspired Netflix series" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Baby Reindeer star Richard Gadd admits he 'made mistakes' with real stalker that inspired Netflix series</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Inside Netflix’s stalker drama Baby Reindeer that is based on terrifying true story - details" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/35e1a7e16fdf-babyreindeeruniversal-basena02zxx.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Inside Netflix’s stalker drama Baby Reindeer that is based on terrifying true story - details" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Inside Netflix’s stalker drama Baby Reindeer that is based on terrifying true story - details</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eg8CUS6EOQv data-wc=65>He also confirmed that he now had a restraining order against her where she was unable to contact him or his friends and family.
