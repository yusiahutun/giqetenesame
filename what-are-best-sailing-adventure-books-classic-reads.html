Classic reads about life on the high seas</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He sarcastically recounts his time spent with rough Finns and other Europeans, many of whom did not share his language. Eventually, Newby is forced to fight the nearest person to prove himself worthy of their respect.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Little did Newby know that his entertaining tales of experiences at sea aboard Moshulu would be about the last grain race, before the second world war broke out. It gives an incredible insight into a different world and is delivered in a less serious tone than many similar books.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/07/11/62c31a32-9e31-11e9-baa5-dd214ed0de8f_972x_142233.jpg><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">The Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1968, the last great remaining “first” to be achieved was to sail around the world, solo and non-stop. No one knew if it was possible for a person to last that long alone, let alone if a boat could withstand the physical challenges of such a voyage. The British Sunday Times newspaper sponsored The Golden Globe Race, the first non-stop, single-handed, round-the-world yacht race.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Sailor, 73, wins round-the-world race using only technology from 1968</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among the adventurous sailors who entered was Donald Crowhurst. He captured the nation’s imagination. Britons love an underdog and Crowhurst was just that. He had next to no experience but as the race progressed it looked as if he was set to win the prize for fastest (if not first, as they all started at different times) circumnavigation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He never arrived. Instead, his empty but intact boat was found floating in mid-Atlantic. Only his diary was left to explain his fate. The book is an intriguing reconstruction of what is thought to have occurred to him, suggesting his progress around the planet was not all as had been assumed.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">A Voyage for Madmen</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Crowhurst was not the only one to Golden Globe Race challenge. He was one of nine and each of them had incredible stories to tell, even though only one of them finished.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When commentators at the time speculated if the human mind could bear the isolation, they were not far wrong. Of the four who made it beyond the Atlantic (including Crowhurst) one finished, one had his boat sunk and later committed suicide, one took his own life while still at sea and one decided society wasn’t for him and sailed on halfway around the world again before ever setting foot on land.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is an incredible account of a crazy epoch in sailing’s history that culminated in the achievements of winner Robin Knox-Johnston.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/07/11/62faaf24-9e31-11e9-baa5-dd214ed0de8f_972x_142233.jpg><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">Maiden Voyage</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Troubled teenager Tania Aebi was wandering aimlessly through life. Her motivated, but estranged, father, had saved money for her to go to college but began to realise the tuition would be wasted on her.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He gave his daughter a choice. He offered to pay for her education, or he could use the money to buy her a boat on the condition she sailed it solo around the world in an attempt to set the record for the youngest solo circumnavigation. On her return, he would sell the boat and have the money for college if she chose to continue her formal education after the trip.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tania chose to take up the marine challenge. The only problem was she did not know how to sail. The teenager had sailed with her father before, but never bothered to pay close attention to his instructions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She bumbles through the first few passages, reaching her destinations by luck as much as skill as she gets to grips with the art of sailing. As she sees the world alone at sea, changes come over her on this epic adventure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/07/11/6249616a-9e31-11e9-baa5-dd214ed0de8f_972x_142233.PNG><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0">Desperate Voyage</h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">John Caldwell met the love of his life in Australia while he was serving in the US military during the second world war. As the conflict drew to a close, he envisaged a life with her Down Under. But a couple more assignments left him in the US with no way of getting back to Australia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He grew desperate, and even tried to stow away on a ship. Eventually, in 1946, he bought a boat and with no experience whatsoever sailed across the Pacific back to his loved one. The journey is full of peril, introspection and love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/07/11/620dac2e-9e31-11e9-baa5-dd214ed0de8f_972x_142233.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqK2kmbywvo6er62qlaKybr%2FPqKmtq1%2BWv7W1wqWcaGtgZoVygZBorqGZpGKus7GMm5ysrF2orqq4yKeeZpmUq7KvwNSrnGaan6S4tHnCpZisq5mYerOxwJ2q</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
