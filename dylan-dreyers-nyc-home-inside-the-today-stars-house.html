The<a href=#> Today</a> star lives in a <a href=#>gorgeous apartment</a> with her little ones and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Brian Fichera</strong></a>.</p><h2>Where Does Dylan Dreyer Live?</h2><p>Dylan and Brian live in a beautiful apartment in NYC with their kids. Initially, they lived in a smaller apartment after getting married in 2012. They put the one-bedroom, one-bathroom place on the market in 2015 before finding their current digs.</p><p>The weathercaster loves to cook and often shows off her stunning kitchen with a marble kitchen island in photos on Instagram. Her children also love joining her in the kitchen to help out with cooking, grabbing things out of the cream-colored cabinets or sitting in one of the chairs to watch.</p><p>“Calvin and Ollie literally love to help in the kitchen no matter what I’m making,” Dylan told <a href=#>Hello! Magazine</a> ahead of Thanksgiving in 2023. “They‘ll ask to help peel potatoes or prep the stuffing, but they enjoy making the pumpkin pie and apple crisp the most!”</p><p>While showing photos of her home on social media over the years, the meteorologist faced a lot of criticism from her followers due to the tight living quarters. She addressed the trolls in an Instagram post in January 2022, sharing a look at her boys’ room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Where-Does-Dylan-Dreyer-Live-Photos-of-New-York-City-Home.jpg><p>“‘You have to move,’ they said. ‘You’ll never fit in your apartment,’ they said. ‘Time for a bigger place,’ they said. This is how you do it in NYC. I think they all fit just fine … for now. #nycliving #my3sons #roommates,” she captioned a photo of her sons in their shared bedroom.</p><p>So far, Dylan has not revealed whether or not she plans to move out of the apartment any time soon. It seems like it’s located in a prime location, right near the Today studio where Dylan appears each day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dylan-Dreyers-NYC-Home-Inside-the-Today-Stars-House.jpg><h2>Does Dylan Dreyer Own a Vacation House?</h2><p>In addition to her NYC apartment, Dylan also owns a second home in New York’s South Shore, according to Hello! Magazine. The seafront home boasts a huge kitchen with plenty of space for her kids to join her while cooking up delicious dishes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dylan-Dreyer-Home.jpg><p>Dylan once admitted that things in her house can get a bit messy with three young children running around. In January 2023, the TV personality shared an Instagram photo of Calvin making himself a sandwich in the kitchen. Her followers couldn’t help but notice several items left on the counter in the picture.</p><p>“Your counter makes me feel normal. Clean bottles drying and a fresh Tylenol. Kids man,” one person commented on the post. Dylan replied, “Oh man and that’s just what you can see! It’s a nightmare.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dsKWZnmKxs7HYnqmsZZ6usG60zqacZqGeqLalsYytn55lpKSxosWMrKuaqqNitbDB0p5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
