It is one reason why most games you find on any gaming platform are built for the male gender in mind. As a result, many girls looking to play a video game can find it challenging to find one that suits their personalities. But in recent years, many female gamers have risen to compete with boys. However, most of them prefer playing specific games.

Animal Crossing</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Animal Crossing</a> is one of the best video games for girls, especially between<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> 19 and 24</a>. The game is popular among ladies because it incentivises creativity by allowing players to decorate and modify their island to their liking. Furthermore, the game is about friendship, community, and <a href=#>family</a>, three factors that appeal to the female gender.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike many other games, it provides players with an escapist dreamland that is at once comforting, relaxing, and heart-warming. In addition, although many girls love playing the game, the face options in Animal Crossing for a <a href=#>player</a> character are gender-neutral, even if one has no possibility of choosing between being a boy or a girl.</p><h3>2. Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</h3><p class=align-left>If you are familiar with the Assassin’s Creed video game <a href=#>series</a>, you know by now that most people that buy and play the game are male. That has been the case with previous releases but not with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</a>. It is an action-adventure video game that lets players take turns playing as both a male and female protagonist.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fa16ffdcc0ccfb74.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best multiplayer horror games you should play in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is also the first game in the series to introduce a female character.

That is why <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bejewelled</a> has become one of the best games for girl gamers because of the many puzzles one must solve. Generally, Bejewelled is a poster child for a genre of casual<a href=#> games </a>that revolve around shifting coloured blocks to match three or more of them in a line.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike many traditional video games, Bejewelled does not have the option for a gamer to set the difficulty level. Instead, the game is all about how far you can go when playing it.
