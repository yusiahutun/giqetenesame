It was then that I knew that I could cook," she narrated as reported by the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Diaspora Messenger</a>.<p class=align-left>Her desire to popularise Kenyan food among UK residents birthed Kenya Kitchen. She opined that Kenya was known for its tourism and athletics but not its food. As such, she embarked on a journey to fill the gap.</p>"I opted to carve out this niche and tell the Kenyan story through food. I felt there was a gap in the market for Kenyan food, and there are so many cuisines. So, I opted to introduce Kenyan food to the world," she said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/598cbb740d76ec02.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Catherine Kasavuli: Colleagues Pen Glowing Tributes to TV Presenter After Succumbing to Cancer</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Her restaurant located at Edgware sells mbuzi choma (roasted goat meat), mushenye (sweet potato mashed in beans), mokimo kienyeji, Kenya-style <a href=#>pilau</a>, traditional style tilapia, ugali, sukuma wiki and other vegetables.</p><h2>Margaret's father's role</h2><p class=align-left>Margaret's father, Kennedy Bwire, disclosed that she motivated his daughter to establish the restaurant after her cooking skills went viral.</p><p class=align-left>Bwire who serves as Kenya Kitchen's accountant explained that she was invited by a person who saw her work online to cook and people loved her food.</p>"People suggested then that she start selling her food because they love it," he said.<p class=align-left>The restaurant has hosted Kenyans from all walks of life.
