From protest trucks to devoted fans pouring support, Seventeen Joshua‚Äôs face has been plastered all over Seoul and other cities in recent weeks.</strong></p><p>Joshua‚Äôs dating rumor frenzy was intensified by the fact that his label Pledis Entertainment has not released a statement even after a week of fans urging the <a href=#>music</a> company to take a stand. The silence can be interpreted in many ways and fans refuse to take it as a direct confirmation of the K-pop star‚Äôs dating rumor.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1404120135-820x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-seventeen-star-joshua-caught-in-dating-rumor>Seventeen star Joshua caught in dating rumor</h2><p>Seventeen star Joshua‚Äôs face has been spotted in multiple trucks in South Korea during the last couple of days after a report claiming Joshua is dating an influencer named Jo Mi Young went viral attracting netizens‚Äô attention. Many Seventeen fans chose not to believe the reports as the K-pop act‚Äôs company Pledis did not confirm the news but some fans found the need to send a message to the company urging them to release a statement.</p><p>Carats as Seventeen fans are called showed protests by sending trucks all over Seoul. Many vehicles were spotted containing positive messages for Joshua expressing how much he means to the fandom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1404120153-661x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joshua‚Äôs dating frenzy could cost fans over $1000</h2><p>The culture of sending a protest truck as well as coffee trucks is very common in South Korea where fans establish a direct communication with the artists and their companies by expressing support or disagreement. As per <a href=# rel=nofollow>reports</a>, the cost of sending a single protest truck for a day could be as high as $220, and for a week, the cost hikes up to somewhere around $1540.</p><p>Along with protest trucks, fans generally also send support trucks. In the particular case of Joshua, many support trucks were spotted in Seoul who could be comforted seeing the unconditional love that Carats have for him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>SEE !!!! there are (real) c-carats who sent trucks to show support for joshua. ü§ç true carats are all in this together! all love for shua.</p><p>(cr. suki_susuw) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/miGFbt4HD9</a></p>‚Äî chel ‚äπ (@byuumie) <a href=#>August 11, 2023</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The culture of protest trucks and how it shapes the view of the mass</h2><p>Experts believe that the culture of sending a protest truck to a company or an artist is rather effective as many passersby who were not aware of the issue could also be aware and their claims can reach a bigger audience prompting the companies to take a stand.</p><p>‚ÄúCompanies take utmost care to show the best version and image of themselves, so when consumers get people unrelated to the issue involved, it damages the companies a lot,‚Äù Kim Si Wuel, a professor of consumer-information science at Konkuk University told Korean media. Hence, a protest truck or a series of protest trucks could be very powerful in spreading a message.</p><p>For more Celebrity Tidbits stories, follow us on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook</a>.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2aBcL%2FEr5ynrJWau26%2F05qpZqKfqLW2rdJmm5qsmaO0br7UpqarZZansq%2FG2GaaqK2cmXqku9KtZJ%2BZnqh6sMLEq2RqaGBlfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
