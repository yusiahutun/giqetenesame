Instagram, meet my little man,” the Netflix personality, 27, <a href=#>captioned an Instagram carousel of snaps of the newborn</a>, including one where Bowden and his son watched <a href=#>an episode of&nbsp;<i>Love Is Blind&nbsp;</i>season 4</a>.</p><p class=p1>The Texas resident, who <a href=#>appeared on season 3 of the Netflix pod experiment</a>, added via his Instagram Story: “We went from zaddy onscreen to daddy in real life. Yep, look at that, he just spit up all over us, didn’t he?”</p><p class=p1>While Bowden <a href=#>did not reveal his son’s name nor the identity of the infant’s mother,</a> several of his Netflix costars quickly offered him their&nbsp;congratulations.</p><p class=p1>“Bartise being the first dad after&nbsp;<i>Perfect Match&nbsp;</i>was not on my bingo card,”&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Sexy Beasts&nbsp;</i></a>alum <strong>Kariselle Snow</strong> quipped via <a href=#>Instagram</a> comment on Friday.</p><p class=p1>Bowden and Snow, 27, were both cast as contestants on&nbsp;<i>Perfect Match</i>, which dropped on Netflix in February. On the reality TV competition show<i>,&nbsp;</i>the streaming giant gave several of its fan-favorite personalities a second chance to find love following failed stints on the likes of&nbsp;<i>Love Is Blind, <a href=#>The Circle</a>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Too Hot to Handle</i></a>. Bowden, for his part, ended the show partnered with <strong>Izzy Fairthorne</strong> before <a href=#>ultimately calling it quits</a> when they returned home. Snow chose to match with <a href=#>former hookup<strong> Joey Sasso</strong></a> on&nbsp;<i>Perfect Match</i>, with the&nbsp;<i>Circle&nbsp;</i>champ even proposing during the finale. They <a href=#>also split shortly after heading home</a> following the tropical-set competition.</p><p class=p1>Bowden joined&nbsp;<i>Perfect Match&nbsp;</i>less than one year after <a href=#>fans watched his&nbsp;<i>Love Is Blind&nbsp;</i>journey</a>, which ended when he called off his engagement to <a href=#><strong>Nancy Rodriguez</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“Part of the reason why I said no [is] because I only wanna make that decision one time. Let’s say I say ‘yes,’&nbsp;and we encounter problems&nbsp;or whatever, we’re sticking together,” the senior analyst <a href=#>exclusively told<i>&nbsp;Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;in November 2022</a> of choosing to end his pod-based romance. “[Nancy’s] parents are divorced; my parents are divorced.&nbsp;I’m not going through that. So yes, if I said yes, we would still be together.”</p><p class=p1>He added at the time: “We <a href=#>decided to&nbsp;move forward trying to be friends</a>. Fast forward a few more months, [and] now we’re both in other relationships. And I found it hard to maintain the level of friendship that Nancy wanted with me while I was also trying to be respectful of a new girl I was dating because, you know, she would get jealous that I was talking to Nancy.”</p><p class=p1>While it is unknown if Bowden is still dating <a href=#>his mystery girlfriend or</a> if she is his son’s mother, the reality TV alum and his former fiancée, 32, are not on speaking terms anymore.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I think me realizing that, as the year went by, there were just too many attempts of him trying to be a good friend that don’t align with what [I think] a good friend is,” <a href=#>the speech pathologist told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in February</a>. “I really was such a people pleaser [in my twenties] and it was always, ‘Yes,’ it was always like, ‘I will break my back for whoever, like, needs my help.’ And so, so much of this last two years … since&nbsp;<i>Love is Blind</i>, is that I’ve&nbsp;truly tried to find out where my boundaries are&nbsp;[and] hold them strong.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to read the&nbsp;<i>Love Is Blind&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Perfect Match&nbsp;</i>cast’s sweetest messages about Bowden’s baby boy:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkubDCxGagrGWSobavsNJmmZqqpJ7ApnnWnqOcp52awG590q1km5mSrnqvsdOfo6KwXajBor7SZqmemZOpfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
