With this much music success, one has to think about the millions he is usually racking up every year.

His voice is so unique you would recognise it in any song without having a problem. He is more inclined to upbeat songs as most of his songs have so much energy and vigour. There is no way one of his many hits can come up, and you are left sitting. So, who is Sean Paul? Is Sean Paul the richest reggae musician?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e59336220232c573.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Shepard Smith's partner?

If someone asked you to guess out of the top of your mind how much he is worth, how much would you say he is worth? $500,000 maybe? Too little? Let's go for $1,000,000, is he worth that much?</p><p class=align-left>Sean Paul is estimated to be worth something between<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> $12,000,000$</a> and $14,000,000. Yes, you heard me right. Not one or two million dollars, but somewhere between twelve to fourteen million dollars. You can imagine how much money you need to have so that people start estimating how much you are worth. Most of this money is from album sales, performances and YouTube.
