In the four-week period ending June 3, the brand fell from around 10 percent of all the U.S.' retail beer sales to 7.3 percent. Taking its place as the country's top-selling beer is Mexican brand Modelo Especial, which now accounts for 8.4 percent of U.S. retail beer sales.</p><p>That dip comes after Bud Light, which is owned by parent company Anheuser-Busch, became embroiled in an early-April marketing controversy stemming from a one-off partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.</p><p>Bud Light sent Mulvaney a handful of beers, including one custom Bud Light can with her face on it, and on April 1, she <a href=#>posted an Instagram video of the gift</a> as part of a March Madness promotion. Bud Light's association with a member of the LGBTQ+ community sparked outrage from some of its conservative fan base, who went on to boycott the brand.</p><p>Subsequently, Anheuser-Busch parted ways with two marketing executives, but this attempt to backtrack drew further backlash from LGBTQ+ members and supporters.</p><p>The data showing Modelo Especial's newfound dominance over Bud Light only accounts for off-premise, retail sales, meaning that it does not take into account sales of beer in bars or other establishments selling alcohol for consumption on the premises.</p><p>The Bud Light controversy has been heated in the country genre. <a href=#>Travis Tritt</a> announced plans to <a href=#>discontinue all Anheuser-Busch products</a> from his tour rider, sparking a since-resolved <a href=#>Twitter skirmish</a> with<a href=#> Zach Bryan</a>, who called anti-trans sentiment "completely wrong." <a href=#>Kid Rock</a> posted video of himself opening fire on cases of Bud Light, and <a href=#>John Rich</a> vowed to <a href=#>wipe the beer brand</a> from the shelves of his downtown Nashville bar.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>Garth Brooks</a> -- who's currently planning the opening of his own Nashville hot spot -- says <a href=#>his bar will serve "every brand of beer,"</a> including Bud Light, explaining that it should be up to the consumers what they drink, and <a href=#>adding</a> that "If you're an a--hole, there are plenty other places on Lower Broadway [to go.]"</p><p>The New York Times report cites <a href=#>research</a> showing that the effects of consumer boycotts are often temporary. Bud Light remains the top-selling beer in the U.S. based on year-to-year data, and it also remains the top-selling beer brand by volume.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Country Songs That Name-Check Budweiser or Bud Light</h2><p>Long before all the controversy surrounding Bud Light and the Anheuser-Busch brand sparked in spring 2023, the beer was a staple in country music lyrics. Here are some of the best songs that reference Budweiser or Bud Light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm62UYrmqs8etZKenXaG8r7PEq2Stp6Bir6ax0WaaqKakp7y3sdGssGaan66wsMDTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
