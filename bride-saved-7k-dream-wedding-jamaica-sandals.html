They eventually got married the following year with the help of Travel Counsellor Kelly Smith, who booked the Serenity wedding chapel at Sandals South Coast which they had seen during their Bahamas trip!</p><p id=ec9WUNG2W9yZ data-wc=33>The pair chose to move their planned evening reception from the beach to the gardens which offered their guests shade during their meal – not to mention a beautiful backdrop for their photos.</p><p id=evP7Dmj5qcWt data-wc=61>"Being on the beach you are just fully exposed to that heat and it is so hot," Hannah said. "Whereas in the private garden, we had these two big trees that gave us quite a large area of coverage so that people were then more comfortable. And there was like a little grassy area which we unofficially called the dance floor."</p><p id=euSpncKaYXw8 data-wc=63>They were assigned a wedding planner, Talia, who helped organise (and rearrange) their wedding and fine-tine the details for a stress-free day. After communicating via phone and email from the UK, they met with her on their first day in Jamaica, and she showed them the ceremony and reception locations. She also organised cake tastings, welcome bags for guests, hair appointments and more.</p><p id=e6bwFArIFHWa data-wc=54><strong>"I couldn't believe you only had to stay for three nights to get the wedding free. I was shocked.</strong> It's the things that you get included in the free wedding - it must cost them a fortune to do it for people because obviously, you get your flowers, your cake, your ceremony," she said.</p><h2 dir=ltr>The £7,000 money-saving costs</h2><p id=ejXDbWCRKl0B data-wc=37>That leads us to the matter of money. According to Sandals, couples simply have to book a three-night all-inclusive stay to be eligible for the wedding. So how much did Hannah save? "Oh God, thousands," she laughed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c636e78ab4d8-wedding-cake-z.jpg><p id=epB2Zz9ZqUzQ data-wc=9><strong>The wedding package includes a cake of your choosing</strong></p><p id=efzjjWaQOTYY data-wc=42>"We actually did&nbsp;like a split stay, so we spent our first week in one room.

Plus, we were getting like two weeks of complete sunshine."</p><p id=e8p3ksZma7zw data-wc=57>She went on to explain that <strong>their initial budget was around £20,000, so they saved at least £7,000 with their destination wedding.</strong> And that's including all the extras they chose as a result of booking additional accommodation for their guests – such as a game night in a private area which she described as "so much fun."</p><p id=euHCX7lad-BN data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Best honeymoon destinations 2022: the most romantic spots to visit this year</a></strong></p><p id=eof5yKSBgfnS data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a aria-label="I lied about my honeymoon to get five hotel upgrades – and more couples' confessions" class=hm-link href=#>I lied about my honeymoon to get five hotel upgrades – and more couples' confessions</a></p><p id=eXjJQxMeZI1E data-wc=19>Her budget also included everything the couple bought outside of the Sandals holiday package, such as her wedding dress.</p><p id=e9hXrAcVk7bM data-wc=31>For those on a budget, Hannah said: <strong>"You could have gone for a lot cheaper.
