The warm color helps our pale, sallow or red skin look healthy and glowing. Sure, we know the best way to achieve the look without basking in the sun’s dangerous rays is by slathering on <a href=#>sunless tanners</a>. But as even the most detail-oriented user will tell you, self tanner can end up streaking here and there, leaving behind tale-tell signs that your tan is fake. And the application errors become even more common as we get older and crepiness, rough texture and fine lines start to set into skin.&nbsp;Enter gradual self tanners. They’re easy to use and will give ensure your skin glows as beautifully (and as streak free) as it would after a day spent in the sun. Keep reading to discover the best gradual self tanner recommended by skin pros.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are gradual self tanners?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/image-template.jpg><p>Gradual self tanners are emulsions that contain DHA (Dihydroxyacetone), a sugar-derivative, the main ingredient in all sunless tanning products, says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel Lee Lozina</a>, licensed esthetician, laser technician and founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Water Spa</a> in Oyster Bay, New York. What sets gradual self tanners apart from regular self-tanning formulas is the amount of DHA they contain. “They are developed with a low percentage of DHA to produce very natural results over time and with daily reapplication,” she explains.&nbsp;</p><p>That means that they build a glow over days — plural — instead of just one. The benefit here is that if you do manage to get a streak or two, it’s not as noticeable, as it will be light and hidden by the next day’s layer. “They are great for beginners and also if you are unsure of how dark you want to go!” adds Lozina. “If your skin is very fair and you’re apprehensive about getting too dark too quickly, gradual options are the best.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The benefits of gradual self tanner</h2><p>The golden glow created by self tanner is especially great for aging skin, as it can distract from imperfections like fine lines, spider veins, cellulite and more. That’s because it works like a makeup but for the body. Explains Lozina, “self tanner acts almost like a filter or a tinted moisturizer because it helps even the skin tone, plus it helps blur blemishes, redness and dark circles.”</p><p>And while you may think of tanning as a summer endeavor, there are reasons you might want to reach for a sunless formula in the colder months, too. “Winter is a time when we are outdoors less due to the weather and shorter days so we are not exposed to the daylight as often as we would like,” says Lozina. In other words, a light layer of color may help warm up your skin and bring you a glow 365 days a year – and not just during swimsuit season.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>“I’m a Dermatologist and *This* Is Why It’s So Important to Wear Sunscreen Year Round&nbsp;— Especially in Winter!”</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The 6 best gradual self tanners</h2><p>For help on what formula is best to use, Lozina says, “self tanning mousse and creams are the easiest to work with, in my opinion, because they are ready to go.” Another option are tanning drops, which are great to add to your favorite moisturizer is, but Lonzina says it’s imperative to mix the drops in well so your tan doesn’t look uneven.

Best lotion for anti-aging</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/TAN-ME-BB.jpeg><p><strong>Infinity Sun Tan Me BB&nbsp;</strong>(<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Buy from Infinity Sun, $35</a>)</p><p>Munro’s formula makes the list for being geared toward mature skin.

Some women find they like the control they get when applying gradual self-tanner by hand. However, if you go this route hands should be washed quickly as the DHA will darken your palms if left on your skin. For those who don’t want to use their hands, Munro recommends wearing latex gloves, or even better, reach for a tanning mit, which is designed to spread tanner on smoothly. And many self tanning users are fans of using a mitt as they find that it gives them a better result.&nbsp;</p><p>To start, “always apply on clean, dry skin and start at your feet, working your way up,” says Lozina. This prevents you from smudging the areas you’ve already covered when you lean down to reach your lower body. Lonzina advises to make sure you take time to rub the self tanner into your skin thoroughly. And, she adds, “don’t forget your ears, under your breasts and around your hairline.”&nbsp;</p><p>All you have to do from there is allow the tanner to dry on your skin, and then get dressed as usual. Then you can add another layer of of your gradual tanner the next day. “Apply daily until you reach your desired tan, and then wait three to four days to reapply to maintain your perfect glow,” says Lozina.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For more tips on applying self tanner, watch the below tutorial from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@JeanWatts</a> on YouTube.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>How to Apply Self Tanner Without Staining Hands + Easy Ways To Remove It if You Do</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to extend the results of gradual self tanner</h2><p>As mentioned above, a lasting tan starts with good prep work. “To make your tan last as long as possible, always follow best practices for preparing the skin by cleansing, exfoliating and removing unwanted hair,” advises Munro. And Lozina adds, “avoid using cleansers that have sodium laurel sulfate that strip and dry the skin,” as that can make the color fade more quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, after you’ve reached your desired color, Lozina recommends avoiding scrubs so as not to remove the tanned top layer of skin. And last but not least, moisturize, moisturize, moisturize with both your favorite lotion and also from the inside out by drinking plenty of water. Says Munro, “the more hydrated you are, the longer your tan will last!”</p><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.
