One of the dogs is a German shepherd that she refers to as “a service dog,” investigators said. That dog appears in a video with her that was posted on the social-media app SnapChat, according to the affidavit. The video shows Frazier and the dog having sexual intercourse in February in Myrick. She claimed that it happened in Hattiesburg, the “geo” location of the video shows it was in Myrick.</span></p><p><span>“Frazier admitted she was the one in the video but stated she was forced to do it,” according to the affidavit.</span></p><p><span>“There is no evidence of that claim, but we are investigating it,” JCSD Investigator Sgt. J.D. Carter said.</span></p><p><span>The investigation began after Newton received the disturbing videos from an unidentified person who was concerned about the welfare of the dog. Newton is known for specializing in cases of animal abuse and handling them for the JCSD.</span></p><p><span>Frazier reportedly claimed that she was “threatened to do it” and that “people pay me” to make the videos when JCSD personnel went to the residence to arrest her. There were two men at the residence when she was arrested. SnapChat is a free app.</span></p><p><span>Frazier is set to make her initial appearance in Jones County Justice Court today (Thursday).</span></p><p><span>A conviction for unnatural intercourse carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcL%2FInKJmqKWlvbp7wKuropucmqymfMKamG%2BdlWKxdLHCZmhqnZRihXJ%2FwWabm2mSm4Z0fJicbZxmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
