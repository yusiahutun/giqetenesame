The bold country songstress lets loose with her interviewer, dishing about her body issues (or lack therof), her marriage to <a href=#>Blake Shelton</a> and what it's like to live on the road. This one is a must-read not just for country music fans, but for anyone who has struggled with their self image in the past.<span id=more-93413></span></p><p>Lambert is on the cover of the issue, and inside, dishes on everything from healthy eating, to exercise, to her ideal body size in a list dubbed <a href=#>15 Things I'll Never Apologize For</a>.</p><p>"I don't care about being stick-thin. I don't want stuff to jiggle. Really skinny actresses make me hungry," Lambert admits. "I see them and think, Honey, you need to eat! I'm lucky I don't have to live like that. I feel my best when I'm a toned, not flabby, size 8. Women come up to me and say, 'You're beautiful and confident,' and that makes me feel I can be, too."</p><p>Of course, the 'White Liar' hitmaker isn't only getting an ego boost from her fans. In the past, Lambert has been at the mercy of media scrutiny involving her sometimes fluctuating weight. When looking at old pictures of herself, Lambert probed her husband for answers about her body. "I asked Blake, 'Dude, why didn't you tell me I got fat?'" she spills. "He said, 'That would go over like a lead balloon. It's not my job to tell you you're fat. It's my job to tell you're beautiful.'"</p><p>Like many people, Lambert says she "absolutely hates exercise," but that she does it anyway to appease her trainer. "I love it afterward, of course," she reveals. "But my trainer is so nice, I want to do push-ups to please him!"</p><p>Because she's on stage night after night, she does get a pretty good workout rocking her guitar and prancing around the arena -- but Mrs. Shelton watches what she eats, too, and has a chicken salad waiting for her after her action-packed shows. All that rocking out is bound to make a body tired, but the country songstress doesn't give into the temptation to eat a greasy burger and fries.</p><p>"I always scarf down food after a show. But now, instead of eating a burger, I'll have a grilled-chicken salad waiting for me," she says. "And except for almonds and bananas, I don't keep snacks on the bus. I don't want Cheetos anywhere around me."</p><p>But while the singer does what she can to stay fit, she's not about to give up the things she truly loves in life. "I won't give up what I enjoy to look perfect. I want to find a happy medium between feeling good about my body and still having a beer and some barbecue."</p><p>She adds, "I drink Bacardi. My trainer, Bill, approves. I mean, he'd rather me not drink, but that's not an option."</p><p>So what's Lambert's favorite part of her body? Her butt. "I don't mind having a big butt," she says. "I actually like that about myself." We can't help but wonder if Blake agrees!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpqGilrulrYylmKaalafBbq7OnbBmnaiav6S10p5krJ2cm3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
