James was the name of her first child from her first marriage. She met Ted Bundy (Theodore Robert Bundy) later that year while working for the Washington State Department of Emergency Services (DES). Ted was on trial at the time for a series of gruesome house killings after being caught in Florida. In 1979, the pair married in a courtroom in front of a judge.</p><p>The next day, Ted was sentenced to death for the third time. Carole also claimed that he was innocent even though he was on trial. Boone, on the other hand, had no idea he was abusing and murdering women while they were still together. She paid regular visits to him in prison and even smuggled drugs through her cervix. During one of her visits, she fell pregnant and gave birth to a daughter called Rose in October 1981. Ted Weiner was said to have started dating Diana Weiner. Carole divorced him in 1986 after a long marriage. Carole changed her identity to Abigail Griffin and moved to Oklahoma with her children, according to reports. She had the option of remarrying and keeping her personal life private. On January 24, 1989, Bundy was put to death in the Raiford electric chair.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity wife</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Wiki, Career, Son, Age And Husband Of Liz Trujillo</a></h3>Most people know Liz Trujillo as Flavor Flav's wife.
