They mark the first gramophones for the singer, almost two decades after releasing her first-ever single. She was overjoyed as she took to the stage, and it wouldn’t be <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> if she didn’t add a cheeky comment in there.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1986879397-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-cyrus-forgot-her-underwear-at-the-grammys>Miley Cyrus “forgot her underwear” at the Grammys</h2><p>The star was buzzing with joy as she got up to receive her second award, hugging and celebrating with <a href=#>Billie Eilish</a>.</p><p>Miley had an outfit change from her Gold Maison Margiela Gown made of safety pins, picking up the award for Record of The Year wearing a one-shoulder sequined purple dress. However, the stress of changing may have made her forget one important item…</p><p>Whilst getting up on stage and doing her thank you speech, the star hilariously exclaimed: “I don’t think I forgot anyone… but I think I forgot my underwear… bye.”</p><p>The speech is doing the rounds on X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a> and fans can’t get enough. Luckily for the 31-year-old, there was no wardrobe malfunction in sight.</p><p>“It’s Miley’s world and we’re just living in it,” wrote one.</p><p>Another exclaimed: “MILEY CYRUS IS ALWAYS GONNA BE ICONIC!”</p><p>“What a classic Miley Cyrus thing to say! Love that she didn’t change it up for the Grammys!” commented another.</p><p>A fourth suggested: “We should all take a lesson from Miley Cyrus and live less seriously.” We second that!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-rock-star-hair-takes-center-stage>Her ‘rock star’ hair takes center stage</h2><p>Honestly, it really was Miley’s world last night. Aside from winning her first-ever Grammy <a href=#>Awards show,</a> her safety pin dress, and her ‘missing’ underwear, social media were raving about her 80’s rock star hairdo.</p><p>The Flowers singer rocked a huge bouffant do, and the internet was here for it. Well, most of them. Some were drawing similarities with her godmother, Dolly Parton’s ‘beehive,’ as some compared her to the legend, Tina Turner: “Miley Cyrus released her inner Tina Turner: hair, dress and dance moves.”</p><p>“I know someone at home watching the Grammys thinks Miley Cyrus’ hair looked bad tonight but I need you to know that actually it is SO chic. Expert work because this probably shouldn’t work” commented another.</p><p>“Miley Cyrus rocking the 80s gym teacher hair with the Princess Leia dress. Fire combo,” gushed another.</p><p>Others weren’t as big fans, with one even saying she gives “Dog The Bounty Hunter vibes.” Don’t worry Miley, we think you slayed!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WCcLPRmqSmsaNiuqq4xLJknLGiqsBuss6rnp6so2K1pr6MrqWdnaKssqK%2BjKKlZp6ipLu1ec6fZGtoYGV9brzEqKelnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
