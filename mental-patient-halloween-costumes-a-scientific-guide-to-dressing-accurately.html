If they will insist on dressing like people with mental health problems, they may as well do it accurately.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Another year, another Halloween approaching, another business gets called out for <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">thinking mental illness is a perfectly fine idea for a Halloween costume</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>While it’s <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">not the first time this has happened</a>, things may be improving; the portrayal of mental illness in the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">media is not as bad as it once was</a>, and the establishment responsible for this latest incident at least responded quickly and effectively.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Sadly, given the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">frantic commercial exploitation of Halloween</a>, the fact that offensive stereotyping is acknowledged as bad <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">unless it’s in the form of a Halloween costume</a>, and many people who still see <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">mental health issues as fair game for a laugh</a>, it’s probably going to keep happening.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Maybe you’re wondering what all the fuss is about? Obviously people have different views on the matter, but the main issue is that these so-called “mental patient” costumes are an extremely negative and ridiculous portrayal of an <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">already marginalised group</a> of innocent people (who make up <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">a substantial chunk of the population</a>)</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Halloween is supposed to be about scary things (or <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">sexy things</a> these days, for some reason). Yes, some bedraggled individual running at you with a blood-stained cleaver is scary, but that’s because they’re clearly a murderer. You should be scared of murderers, regardless of their mental health situation. Despite what opponents of gun control might like to imply, those with mental health issues are <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">highly unlikely to harm anyone</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>And yes, the mainstream portrayal of asylums is a scary one, but asylums were mostly <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">scary places for the inmates</a>, not because of them, given the sort of things done to them there.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>So, if you will insist on dressing like someone with a serious mental illness for <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Halloween</a>, here’s how to do it accurately.</p><h2 id=depression><strong>Depression</strong></h2><figure id=90d34456-44db-4fab-a8a2-066c7a6aee28 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>This is what people with depression might look like.</span> Photograph: Alamy</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>To dress like someone with serious depression, just wear your normal clothes. But you should take several hours to put them on due to a <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">chronic low mood and almost complete lack of motivation</a>. It may be hard to replicate this sensation if you don’t actually have depression, so try wearing a rucksack filled with anvils and bowling balls to get a sense of the effort required to do the most basic task.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>You should also try to convince yourself that you are <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">essentially worthless</a> and interpret any remark <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">said about you (or not) as a thinly-veiled but cutting criticism</a>. If this is too difficult, try <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">not having any emotional response to anything at all</a>. This may seem counterproductive at a time of celebration, but accuracy is important.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>To best portray someone in the grips of severe depression, don’t go to a Halloween party.</p><h2 id=schizophrenia><strong>Schizophrenia</strong></h2><figure id=dc94df3a-ae30-46fa-aaa2-1faf3abb5e0e data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>This is what people with schizophrenia may look like.</span> Photograph: Alamy</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>To dress like someone with serious schizophrenia, just wear your normal clothes.
