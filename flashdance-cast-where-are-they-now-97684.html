It feels like yesterday when we watched Alex Owens (played by Jennifer Beals) dance away in the hit movie. And in honor of the film’s milestone anniversary, we’re seeing where she and the rest of the cast are now!</p><p>During a previous interview on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen</a>, Jennifer actually opened up about the 1983 flick and shared something about her role we never knew (she was a welder by day and a dancer by night). “I had like three dance doubles and one was a guy,” she shared. What?! “I mean, I probably was a better field hockey player, but I could dance. I was relatively coordinated and I took dance classes, but I never would have thought of myself as a dancer. But I love to dance.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/flashdance.jpg><p>And after all these years, Jennifer still loves when fans ask her about Flashdance (if we met her, we’d definitely have to ask her). “I don’t mind it at all [when people ask about Flashdance], but to be honest like a lot of people ask me about The L Word or they’ll ask me about Book of Eli,” she said. “And just today I had somebody talk to me about The Bride of Frankentstein.”</p><p>Perhaps Jennifer would consider a Flashdance sequel for the blockbuster’s 40th anniversary in another five years? That’s surely something we’d watch!</p><p><b>Scroll through the gallery below to see the cast of <i>Flashdance</i> then and now!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46fo5qrmJmur6%2FEZpqaq6RixKmx0Z5kmqqVYsGpsdhmpaivXW6Ed4STaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
