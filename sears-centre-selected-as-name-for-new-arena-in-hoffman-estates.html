The arena is expected to attract 750,000 visitors to more than 135 events annually and be a significant boon to the local economy. Sears secured the naming rights for the arena as part of a 10-year agreement.</p><p>"We're proud to have Sears as part of the name of the new arena, because we believe the 'Sears Centre' will provide area families with new and exciting ways to spend time together," said Robert J. O'Leary, Sears' senior vice president of public relations and government affairs. "We also think the Sears Centre will be an economic catalyst, not only for Prairie Stone, but for Hoffman Estates and the surrounding areas, and we are very encouraged by the interest shown in the facility so far."</p><p>The naming of the arena follows the announcement by the United Hockey League that it plans to expand its league and will add a team that will call the "Sears Centre" its home beginning with 2006-2007 season. With pre-season and playoff games, a UHL franchise can expect to play 40-46 home games per year.</p><p>"The naming of the arena, the announcement by the United Hockey League, the appointment of Steve Hyman as executive director of the facility and our ongoing design work, all are further shaping the identity of and creating positive momentum for the project," said Jeff Smith, president of the Midwest Division of Ryan Companies US, Inc.</p><p>Ryan Companies will serve as the General Partner of the partnership and own a 75 percent interest in the partnership. Ryan Companies also will provide design, development and construction services. Sears will hold the remaining 25 percent interest and contribute the land for the development.</p><p>Seating capacity for the "Sears Centre" will be up to 6,000 for theater productions, 9,000 for hockey and soccer games, 10,000 for basketball and 11,000 for "center stage" concerts. Parking for the arena will accommodate 2,500 vehicles. The arena will feature 40 conference suites and 1,000 club seats with the balance being "general admission" seats. The facility will feature a private club, with complete restaurant service, and six locker and dressing rooms.</p><p>Events the partnership expects to host include family entertainment shows, concerts, ice shows, family programs, hockey games, arena football games, college basketball tournaments, tennis matches and tournaments, boxing matches and exhibitions. –by CelebrityAccess Staff Writers</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGirlZa%2FtHnCnqWtqpViwKa4xJyrnpxdlsBuusCmnGaen6d6r7HWZpirnZ6Weqq6jKGmn56dlrtusdKtmK2do2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
