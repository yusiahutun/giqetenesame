Box braids. Faux locs. Dutch braids ... there are so many <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>braiding styles</a> to choose from. And while you can't really go wrong with any type of braid, believe us: Goddess braids are one look you absolutely won't regret.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The boho chic braid style has been everywhere — from Janelle Monáe to Gabrielle Union — and it's not hard to see why. "Goddess braids are a great <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>protective style</a> because they are super cute, versatile, and they last for about four to eight weeks, so they're a great low-maintenance option," says hairstylist Geneva Fowler. To find out more, we spoke with Fowler to get all of her tips and tricks to pulling off this plaited style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for our expert-approved guide to goddess braids.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>What Are Goddess Braids?</h3><p>Goddess braids (a.k.a. boho braids) are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>box braids</a> with curly strands added to hair's mids or ends, resulting in an undone, bohemian style.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-install-goddess-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Install Goddess Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've had box braids before, you'll know that they take a while to install, but the results are totally worth it. Depending on the size and length of your goddess braids, they can take anywhere from four to eight hours to finish, so make sure you have a good book or a long playlist with you.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-prep-your-hair-for-goddess-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Prep Your Hair for Goddess Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The number-one rule before getting any protective style is to make sure your hair is clean. Shampooing your hair before installing goddess braids is important and can help prevent an itchy scalp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next, Fowler suggests a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>deep conditioning</a> treatment. "Conditioning the hair and scalp helps to ensure they are healthy and ready for the installation," she says. "Following your conditioning treatment, I recommend blow-drying your hair straight to make installing the goddess braids easier for your braider."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: 8 Mistakes You Didn't Know You Were Making with Your Protective Style</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-goddess-braid-aftercare></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Goddess Braid Aftercare</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want your braids to last at least four weeks, you need to give them a little TLC. Fowler likes to apply <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Shine N' Jam Foam</a> once a week to help refresh the braids. You also want to make sure you are taking care of your scalp. "I recommend using a gentle cleanser to keep your scalp clean and healthy," the hairstylist says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-wash-goddess-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Wash Goddess Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Washing goddess braids is not as hard as it might seem, just make sure you take your time. "Start by applying shampoo to your hair and gently scrub your scalp with your fingertips," instructs Fowler. "Let the shampoo run through your braids naturally, then rinse your hair with cold water. After washing, wrap your braids in a scarf to make sure your natural hair lays flat and as neat as possible."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-remove-goddess-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Remove Goddess Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You'll know that it's time to take out your goddess braids when they begin to look too worn in," says Fowler. I personally take them out when the curly goddess hair starts to get ratty or my scalp gets too itchy and uncomfortable."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To remove the goddess braids, cut the plait about an inch below where your natural hair ends. "The blunt cut will make the braids unravel faster and you will end up with less hair to unbraid especially if you had super long braids installed," explains Fowler.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-cost-of-goddess-braids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Cost of Goddess Braids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The price for getting goddess braids depends on the length you get and your location.
