X User @MooreFoodPlz pointed <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://twitter.com/MooreFoodPlz/status/1782118707726078353 rel=nofollow>out her profile</a> and tweets from 2014 quoting one of them: “<a href=# rel=nofollow>@MrRichardGadd</a> your tweets cheer me up. ive not been able to get into hawley past three saturdays.your timeline is good!” The X user also pointed out that Hawley was a bar in Camden in London. Another big clue included a tweet from her saying “@MrRichardGadd my curtains need hung badly” which is referenced in the show.</p><p>In a TikTok video by<a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.tiktok.com/@goldennhourrr/video/7360401034461629738> GoldennHourrr</a> that displayed alleged evidence, many fans took to the comments to react. “How tf did they find her??? Man this is scary,” one user commented However many fans also were aware of the privacy that Gadd wanted to provide for his former stalker. “There is no reason for anyone to go looking for her Richard Gadd had said to leave her alone. Why give her the attention she clearly doesn’t need?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-baby-reindeer-s-martha-in-real-life>Who is Baby Reindeer’s Martha in real life?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/baby-reindeer-martha-real-life.jpg><p>Gadd has not disclosed the identity of the real-life Martha due to privacy as well as legal reasons. “We’ve gone to such great lengths to disguise her to the point that I don’t think she would recognize herself,” he explained to GQ. “What’s been borrowed is an emotional truth, not a fact-by-fact profile of someone.”</p><p>The creator and comedian himself, doesn’t know where the whereabouts of <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1355878/you-season-4-review/>the real-life Martha.</a> He had a restraining order against her but did not want her to go to prison. According to an interview with The Times UK, he “didn’t want to throw someone who was that level of mentally unwell in prison.” He felt “mixed feelings about it” but that the situation was now “resolved.”</p><p>On why he felt a sense of empathy for the real life Martha, he told <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/baby-reindeer-netflix-richard-gadd-interview?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned" rel=nofollow>GQ UK</a>, “Someone comes in who seems very normal, they seem perfect, but <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1355878/you-season-4-review/>bit by bit</a> they get weirder and weirder. Stalking is a mental dysfunction, it’s an illness and I wasn’t dealing with someone who felt calculated or insidious. I felt I was dealing with someone who was vulnerable, somebody who was mentally ill, someone who couldn’t stop because they believed what was in their head.”</p><p>“I can think of numerous examples where people have complained to the police about a stalker but because maybe they’ve had a previous relationship the police haven’t taken it seriously. They can look for a concrete reason to arrest… but sometimes situations are more nuanced than that. The first thing the police should do is try to preserve the safety of the person who is making the report rather than going through a long, arduous process to work out whether they should believe them or not.”</p><p>A woman who claimed to be the inspiration of Martha came forward to <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13355135/truth-comedian-female-stalker-gripped-world-Netflix-Baby-Reindeer-fame-fortune.html>Daily Mail</a> to talk about her thoughts on the show. “‘He’s using Baby Reindeer to stalk me now,” the anonymous woman told the gossip site. “I’m the victim. He’s written a bloody show about me.” Daily Mail claimed that the woman had an uncanny resemblance to Martha in the show and shares several key similarities with her on-screen persona.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Baby Reindeer is now steraming on Netflix.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Baby-Reindeer-Richard-Gadd.jpg><p>For more on Baby Reindeer, check out <a data-pmc-sp-product=200693afacd379d88c4bf5be9dad0a4e href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Richard Gadd’s book","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Baby Reindeer (Modern Plays)","price":"14.36","id":"1350143421","category":"Playwriting"},"id":1767201,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Richard Gadd’s book</a> and play that inspired the Netflix series.
