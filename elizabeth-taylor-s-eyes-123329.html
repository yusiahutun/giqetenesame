Widely known for having the most striking eyes in Hollywood, Taylor had what appeared to be rare, natural purple irises. They also sometimes looked bright blue — and over the years, their glowing hue led fans to ask questions such as, “Are Elizabeth Taylor’s eyes violet?” or “Does she have lavender eyes?”</p><p>We did a little digging to answer these questions and here’s what we found: Her eye color was actually natural — for the most part. Colored contacts weren’t <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">commercially available until 1983</a>, so Taylor wasn’t faking it. However, she was born with a very specific and rare amount of the pigment melanin. The appearance of the iris, or the colored ring around a person’s eye, is determined by how much melanin it contains.

For example, a white shirt will reflect light onto your irises, making your eyes appear slightly lighter. Fair-colored eyes do reflect more light, so they are more affected by this change. Taylor, with her stunning eyes, was a master of this art, often donning bright, colorful garments in deep red, emerald, and canary yellow to complement her vibrant eyes.</p><p>Of course, makeup was probably also a key factor behind Liz Taylor’s oscillating eye color. The actress was often spotted wearing blue or purple eye shadow to flatter her violet eyes, or donning a deep brown shadow and eyeliner as a contrast to make them pop. But lighting and <a href=#>beauty strategies</a> aside, the legendary actress was obviously naturally gorgeous!</p><p>Keep scrolling for striking, rare photos of Elizabeth Taylor’s eyes at their most dazzling.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Elizabeth Taylor’s Eyes in Photos</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfnK6tuMSrsGialZbCtcWOnqOispGXsrW0jK2YsqSfp3q0ecSynKxlYWeAdH6Y</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
