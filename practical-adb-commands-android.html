But it wasn't always this way. Early Android users had to jump many hurdles to accomplish even basic tasks. One such limitation was having to use Android Debug Bridge (ADB) commands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While many of those commands are irrelevant today, others have stood the test of time. You might use these commands when needed, but the entire process is also fun and helps you appreciate the Android platform better.</p><p>Let's look at some of the most useful ADB commands you should know as an Android user.</p><h2 id=how-to-establish-an-adb-connection-between-your-phone-and-pc>How to Establish an ADB Connection Between Your Phone and PC</h2><p>Before getting to the list of commands, it is necessary to activate ADB commands between your phone and PC. To do so, first connect a USB cable to your phone and PC. Then you'll need to enable <strong>USB Debugging</strong> inside <strong>Developer options</strong>.</p><p>You can unlock this menu by tapping seven times on the <strong>Build Number</strong> inside the <strong>About Phone</strong> section of <strong>Settings</strong>. See our <a href=#>guide to USB Debugging</a> for more info.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tap-the-build-number-seven-times-settings.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/developer-options-usb-debugging.png> <span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Next, download and install <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Second ADB Installer</a> on your Windows PC. If you're using macOS or Linux, see our <a href=#>guide to using ADB and Fastboot</a> for instructions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Installation-Process-of-15-Second-ADB-Installer.png><p>After the installation is complete, open the Command Prompt. To do this, type <strong>cmd</strong> in the Start menu's search box.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Launching-Command-Prompt-Using-Search.png><p>Now, type <strong>adb devices </strong>into the Command Prompt window and hit <strong>Enter</strong>. If everything is set up correctly, you’ll see your phone listed under the <strong>List of devices attached</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Entering-ADB-Devices-in-Command-Prompt.png><p>Once you see this message, you are ready to test ADB commands on your phone. If for some reason, the setup doesn't work, you can <a href=#>troubleshoot the ADB connection</a>.</p><h2 id=5-useful-adb-commands-worth-knowing>5 Useful ADB Commands Worth Knowing</h2><p>The commands listed below are helpful regardless of your level of expertise. Whether you are a beginner or an Android power user, these ADB commands will prove beneficial at some point or another.</p><h3 id=adb-reboot>1. adb reboot</h3><p>Rebooting is the first fix that comes to mind when you're faced with an error on the phone. No matter which phone you have, there will come a time when you have to reboot it, perhaps forcefully. For example, your phone might freeze or display an error, prompting you to restart it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This ADB command is a simple way to reboot your phone without even touching it. It can particularly come in handy in case your power button stops working, for whatever reason.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ADB-Command-to-Reboot-the-Phone.png><h3 id=adb-install>2. adb install</h3><p>Manually downloading and installing APK files is a common practice for many Android users. Due to various rules and regional restrictions, Google Play doesn't always offer the apps you want.</p><p>In such cases, you can download the APK on your PC and install it on your smartphone using this ADB command. This way, you won't have to transfer the file to your phone and install it from the phone's File Manager.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To use this command, add the APK file path at the end of the line and hit <strong>Enter</strong>. For example, if you want to install an APK file named <strong>Cortana</strong>, type in the following command, replacing the example path with the actual location of the file on your PC:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">adb install C:\Users\Username\Desktop\Cortana.apk</code> </pre><p><strong>Keep the following in mind:</strong></p><ul><li>On Windows, you can easily get a file's path by holding <strong>Shift</strong>, right-clicking on the file, and choosing <strong>Copy as path</strong>. This will give you a full link to the location that you can paste into the Command Prompt. You can also choose <strong>Properties</strong> from the right-click menu and copy the <strong>Location</strong>, if you prefer.</li><li>It is best to rename the APK file to a short name, for convenience.</li><li>While entering the command, make sure it ends with <strong>.apk</strong>.</li><li>Be careful where you download APKs. Stick to <a href=#>safe APK download sites</a>, and avoid anywhere shady that promises paid apps for free.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Installing-an-App-through-ADB-Command.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=adb-shell-dumpsys-iphonesybinfo>3. adb shell dumpsys iphonesybinfo</h3><p><a href=#>Your phone's IMEI number</a> is a unique identification for the device. Therefore, it's a good idea to keep a record of the IMEI numbers of your phones for safety and legal purposes.</p><p>You can check and save the IMEI number of your device by dialing <strong>*#06#</strong> in your dialer app and taking a screenshot of it. Alternatively, you can use this ADB command on your PC. It will display the IMEI number in the Command Prompt, which you can copy and paste wherever you want for safekeeping.</p><p>If the command in the above heading doesn't work, here's another ADB command for grabbing your phone's IMEI number:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">adb shell <span class=hljs-string>"service call iphonesubinfo 4 | cut -c 52-66 | tr -d '.[:space:]'"</span></code> </pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ADB-Command-to-Check-the-IMEI-Number.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=adb-shell-cmd-package-list-packages--3>4. adb shell "cmd package list packages -3"</h3><p>Most people know the pain of installing too many apps that end up hogging your phone's storage and RAM. But sometimes, looking for <a href=#>apps to uninstall</a> can be a tiresome task. That’s where this little ADB command comes in handy.</p><p>Once you enter this command, you get a complete list of apps installed on your phone. The list gives you an overview of what may be hogging your phone’s memory. The next step is to look for those specific apps and uninstall them.</p><p>Alternatively, this command is also an easy way to save a list of all the apps on your phone for your own records. You might appreciate having this when moving to a new phone, for instance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ADB-Command-to-List-All-Installed-Apps.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=adb-reboot-recovery>5. adb reboot recovery</h3><p>This adb command is slightly more advanced, so it's best to use it with caution. <strong>Recovery</strong> is similar to the <a href=#>BIOS setup in PCs</a>. These are the advanced settings you get by pressing a particular key while your system boots. The most common use of<strong> Recovery</strong> is <a href=#>factory resetting a phone</a> when you can't do it through the usual menu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2b.-android-recovery-mode.jpg><p>With most Android devices, you can enter the <strong>Recovery</strong> by pressing and holding certain key combinations. However, it can be confusing to remember the combinations of different phones. You can avoid all that trouble by simply using this command.</p><p>(<strong>Warning:</strong> You will lose all your data and apps by resetting your device. And if you play around with the other options in the Recovery, they can potentially brick your phone. Don't run these commands unless you're comfortable in these menus.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=getting-the-job-done-with-adb-commands>Getting the Job Done With ADB Commands</h2><p>Now you can let your inner geek out and enjoy running commands on your Android phone through your PC. This easy-to-use list of practical ADB commands will get you started.</p><p>Apart from their usefulness, these commands have a nostalgic and oddly satisfying feel to them, especially when you get them to work for the first time. But there are many more commands to discover once you get comfortable with the interface.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGinq5mTqbakrctmmJ2aXZi8rrnAp5usZZGjsbO7yJ1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
