But this guide will help pave the way throughout. Here are some factors you should think about while purchasing one.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Ingredients&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>First things first, you must check for the ingredients while picking a formula. The best hair color for Asians<strong> </strong>are ones that are free from toxic ingredients like PPD, alcohol, phthalates, silicones, etc. Choose a hair dye made with natural ingredients, such as essential oils, henna, plant extracts, soy, oat milk, etc.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Sensitivity&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>If you have a sensitive scalp, try hypoallergenic or non-irritating formulas. Pick ammonia-free colors as they don’t make your hair rough and dehydrated. However, if you find some traces of ammonia, minimize skin contact and don't overdo the coloring. Plus, you can use a keratin shampoo and conditioner to restore the strength and natural shine of your hair.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Consider Your Skin Complexion&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Your skin color and hair color are interrelated. The correct hair color that compliments your skin complexion results in more fabulous hair looks, while the wrong color might ruin your charm.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of skin complexions, our contributor Nate Masterson, Hair Expert at Maple Holistics, says, “Complimentary skin tones look better with the right color hair dye. The skin is much more visible than the eyes and it may be even more important to ensure that the color of your skin and hair are complimentary. People with cool tones in their skin should opt for blonds, browns and blacks, while people with warm tones should look for gold, caramel and auburn hair dyes.”</p><h3><strong>Determine Your Eye Color&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Colors that contrast with your eye color intensify your overall look. For instance, blonde or caramel tones look on those with blue eyes, while folks with green eyes may try soft red tones. Dark eyes align well with dark colors. However, it's your personal choice in which color you feel the most confident.&nbsp;</p><p>In tandem, Nate Masterson, says, “When choosing a hair dye, the color of your eyes can be complimentary to your hair color. Consider using a shade of dye that highlights the natural color of your eye, or even one that matches it exactly. This can give you a more complete look, and when a different, but complimentary shade is used, it provides dimension to your appearance.”</p><h3><strong>Formula&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Hair colors for Asian hair come in different formulas, from powders to gels and liquids. So look for a hair color that is easy to apply and doesn't create a mess. You can go with non-staining and non-drip formulas that add color with minimum or no mess.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Longevity&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>When you select an Asian hair dye based on longevity, ensure that the product offers staying time for up to 6 to 8 weeks. Also, use gentle shampoos and conditioners that are free from toxins like sulfates to extend the color's longevity.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Use Hair Dye for Asian Hair?</h2></p><p>Follow these steps to apply the hair color correctly.&nbsp;</p><li>Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo to remove dirt and grease.&nbsp;</li><li>Don't apply any haircare product before coloring and after shampooing.
