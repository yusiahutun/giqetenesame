Sikorski said this case now turns from a missing child to a homicide investigation.</p><p>“This news is heartbreaking to both Breasia’s family and our Davenport community. Our deepest sympathies and heartfelt prayers are with all of those who are affected by this tragic loss,” said Sikorski.</p><p>Breasia’s mother, Aishia Lankford, sent a Facebook message to Local 4 News’ Alliyah Sims on Wednesday:</p><p>“Words cannot describe the heartache and emptiness that we feel now that police have confirmed the remains located in DeWitt, Iowa are Breasia. Our love for Breasia has gotten us through the past 9 months and will continue to see us through as we fight for justice. We want to thank the community, law enforcement, friends and family who have put in countless hours to help bring Bree home. We ask for privacy as we grieve the loss of our daughter, sister and friend. Our focus will now be on seeking answers to what happened on the night she was last seen. That’s all I have to say thank you.”</p><p>Sikorski said the investigation continues, and police still need your help.</p><p>“We want our community to know we still need you,” Sikorski said. “If you think you saw something, or you heard something, please contact our investigators.”</p><p>Clinton County worked with Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, Clinton and Davenport, Clinton County medical examiner’s office.</p><p>Henry Dinkins, 48, of Davenport, named a “person of interest” in the case when Breasia disappeared, is in the Clinton County Jail, where he has been in custody for Scott County on an unrelated charge of failure to register as a sex offender.</p><p>Police arrested him soon after Breasia was reported missing July 10 of last year. Ever since, in a case that involved the FBI, people from all over the Quad Cities region have searched areas in Scott and Clinton counties, distributed flyers and shared information and theories about Breasia’s disappearance on social media.</p><p>Detectives said Breasia was last seen at Dinkins’ apartment in Davenport. Officers tracked hundreds of leads, but nothing that led to Breasia.</p><p>In February, Dinkins’ sister, Neda McQuay, told Local 4 News the allegations against her brother make life difficult for her family. On Wednesday, she said she still stands by him.</p><p>“I know Henry did not do it. I feel my brother is paying for somebody else’s crime,” she told Local 4 News.</p><p>“We’re still standing. We’re standing from the beginning and we’re going to stand at the end,” she said. “We feel betrayed. We just feel like justice hasn’t been served.”</p><p>McQuay says Henry and Breasia enjoyed spending time together, and that Henry loved the girl like a daughter and would never hurt her.</p><p>Since Breasia went missing, Dinkins has been adamant with his family: “He just kept telling me ‘I had nothing to do with it.’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>RELATED LOCAL 4 NEWS STORIES</h2><p><strong>EARLIER UPDATE</strong>: An autopsy confirms that “the remains are those of Breasia Terrell,” Davenport Police Chief Paul Sikorski announced Wednesday.</p><p>Watch the entire news conference in the video above or the Facebook Live below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>UPDATE: ‘The remains are those of Breasia Terrell,’ autopsy confirms.
