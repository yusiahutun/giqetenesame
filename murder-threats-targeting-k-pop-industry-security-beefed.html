K-pop stars and their staffers are now also victims of these threats.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘I’m scared of being in South Korea’: stabbing attacks keep residents on edge</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hanam Police Station in Gyeonggi Province revealed on Friday that a man in his 20s – whose identity has been withheld – uploaded a post online saying he would kill nine members of staff at SM Entertainment. SM Entertainment is home to a number of K-pop acts including boy band NCT and girl group aespa.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The man insisted that he committed the act “in a fit of rage,” because he believed an SM artist – a girl group member who he has been following for 10 years ― did not like him. He reportedly sent her social media messages about his feelings for her. The police found he had mapped out a criminal plan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/13/91652707-7b05-4ca5-b569-a42203a958c5_aff010a5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A few days before the incident, SM Entertainment reported an internet user to the police for posting a murder threat on August 7, targeting aespa member Winter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Tomorrow, I will kill Winter, who will fly abroad,” read the post.
