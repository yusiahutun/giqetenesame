Instead, the best bag is one you can incorporate into your daily life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maybe it’s a tote overflowing with shoes and an extra outfit, à la Miu Miu, or dangling with charms that reflect your personal style, like at Coach. If you can manage to wear out the leather the way the Olsen twins do with their Birkins or Balenciaga City bags, that’s even better. A lot of designer bags will even do it for you: Intentional crinkles and scuffs were seen all over the Fashion Month runways, from Balenciaga to Prada.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, if you’re looking for a bag to invest in for next fall, you’re probably considering the cost per wear.

In the last couple of seasons, Prada and Miu Miu each offered bags in quirky pea green. It’s not the color you think of when you envision something as serious as a designer carryall, but as seen on the runways at Gucci and Fendi, it is just as energizing as a pop of red. If anything, it adds a bit of necessary wackiness, making every look feel unexpected in the best possible way.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Green Bags<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Return of the Bucket Bag</h2><img alt="milan, italy february 23 a model walks the runway during the gucci ready to wear fallwinter 2024 2025 fashion show as part of the milan fashion week on february 23, 2024 in milan, italy photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Gucci - Runway - Milan Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2024-2025" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2034795045-65f9eafdd0262.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><p>Gucci FW 2024</p><img alt="new york, usa february 11 a model walks the runway during the ulla johnson ready to wear fallwinter 2024 2024 fashion show as part of the new york fashion week on february 11, 2024 in new york photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Ulla Johnson - Runway - Fall/Winter 2024-2025 New York Fashion Week" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2005057632-65fb00b8c4bd6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><p>Ulla Johnson FW24</p><img alt="paris, france february 29 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the schiaparelli womenswear fallwinter 2024 2025 show as part of paris fashion week on february 29, 2024 in paris, france photo by estropgetty images" title="Schiaparelli : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Fall/Winter 2024-2025" width=3046 height=4569 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2048856484-65fb00dae7dc0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Estrop</span><p>Schiaparelli FW24</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With oversize bags everywhere, micro bags feel like a true relic of runways past. The bucket bag, though—a hot silhouette from the mid-2010s—is making a comeback in the most bite-size proportions. At Ulla Johnson, models dangled suede bucket bags from two fingers as they sauntered down the runway. At Gucci, the trend took a slightly different shape, structured more like a vintage makeup bag. The best thing about the look is how you can’t just toss it over your shoulder; you have to be fully present when wearing it. It’s a bag that demands everyone’s attention, including your own.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Bucket Bags<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Bags Made to Have and to Hold</h2><img alt="paris, france march 05 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the miu miu womenswear fallwinter 2024 2025 show as part of paris fashion week on march 05, 2024 in paris, france photo by victor boykogetty images" title="Miu Miu : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Fall/Winter 2024-2025" width=2667 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2066452219-65f9ecd644e94.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MIU MIU</span><p>Miu Miu FW 2024</p><img alt="london, england february 19 a model walks the runway at the burberry show during london fashion week february 2024 at on february 19, 2024 in london, england photo by joe mahergetty images" title="Burberry - Runway - LFW February 2024" width=4966 height=7449 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2023489504-65f9f91913523.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Joe Maher</span><p>Burberry FW24</p><img alt="milan, italy february 24 a model walks the runway during the bottega veneta ready to wear fallwinter 2024 2025 fashion show as part of the milan fashion week on february 24, 2024 in milan, italy photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Bottega Veneta - Runway - Milan Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2024-2025" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2038644167-65f9f909d9879.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><p>Bottega Veneta FW24</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At Miu Miu this season, every model looked like the coolest girl you know after she’s raided <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a60167443/opera-gloves-trend/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="her even cooler mom’s" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">her even cooler mom’s</a> closet.

The term is rarely used to describe handbags anymore, because most recent styles don’t possess that dainty, ladylike energy…until now. For her most recent show, Anna Sui sourced vintage tapestry and chenille brocade handbags. At Sandy Liang, models used both of their gloved hands to parade a small bag adorned with a bow (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a46203224/bow-trend-explained/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="of course" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">of course</a>) down the runway.

And while “accessories shaped like children’s toys that are actually inspired by dark lore” was not a trend on the runway, bags with a similar fuzzy texture certainly were. At Prada, they were adorned with bright feathers. At Loewe, the popular squeeze bag was covered in intricate beading, like a bumpy floral portrait on leather. Even at Tory Burch, bags were less sleek than normal, with straps encasing flap bags like a small basket. What everyone wants right now is not just a bag to hold, but one to actually touch as well.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Textured Bags<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><h2 data-node-id=37 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Oversize Bags Overflowing With Life</h2><img alt="paris, france march 03 a model walks the runway during the balenciaga ready to wear fallwinter 2024 2025 fashion show as part of the paris fashion week on march 3, 2024 in paris, france photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Balenciaga - Runway - Fall/Winter 2024-2025 Paris Fashion Week" width=2835 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2056347434-65f9f7e4b9982.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><p>Balenciaga FW24</p><img alt="model on the runway at coach rtw fall 2024 as part of new york ready to wear fashion week held at the james b duke house on february 12, 2024 in new york, new york photo by giovanni giannoniwwd via getty images" title="Coach RTW Fall 2024 - Runway" width=3388 height=5077 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1998836166-65f9f818db418.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Giovanni Giannoni</span><p>Coach FW24</p><img alt="paris, france march 05 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the miu miu womenswear fallwinter 2024 2025 show as part of paris fashion week on march 05, 2024 in paris, france photo by victor boykogetty images" title="Miu Miu : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Fall/Winter 2024-2025" width=2667 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2066432810-65f9f80e555a2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Boyko</span><p>Miu Miu FW24</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Oversize bags have been popular now for a couple of seasons. But there has been a recent shift in how they’re styled. At first, bags were big, but completely zipped and sealed. They offered a nice, polished solution for carrying everything you need in your daily life. But last season there was a noticeable shift at Miu Miu, where Miuccia Prada found beauty in an overstuffed bag, with a change of clothing and shoes hanging out the side. As I wrote in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week/a45453718/miu-miu-spring-2024-prep-style-return/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="my review of the show" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>my review of the show</u></a>, “Mrs. Prada knows that to be a woman is sometimes to carry a change of outfit in your bag, so you can transform into another version of yourself that you are already expected to be.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, this idea is everywhere. Bags are starting to reflect not a compartmentalization of life but the bustling nature of it. It’s as if they’re giving you permission to be your full, messy self. At Prada, bags had smaller fabric bags tied around the handle. At Tory Burch, straps were left undone, allowing flaps to fling open down the runway. And at Coach, funky personality tchotchkes dangled from purses, loading them up with personality.</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Big Bags<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
