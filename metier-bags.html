This time, we turn the spotlight on Metier, the logo-less luxury handbag label with a huge A-list following.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">The term <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/g44559652/quiet-luxury-brands/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Quiet Luxury" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Quiet Luxury</a> has been overused of late, but it’s the only way to describe <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://metier.com/pages/women data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Métier class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Métier</a>, a high-end, minimalist handbag label which has become the go-to for an investment bag that will last a lifetime. “Our clients might have plenty to say, but they have nothing to prove,” says Métier's founder, Melissa Morris. “They don’t need large logos to do the talking, they have enough to say for themselves.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The British brand – which launched back in 2017 – offers incredibly well-made leather and suede bags in muted colours and sculptural shapes, which are designed to be carried every day (and have even been quality tested to simulate 20 years of use). Unlike some designer handbags, which are totally focussed on style, Métier puts craftsmanship and clever design at the heart of what it does, but that is not to say that these bags are not still very aesthetically pleasing.</p><img alt=metier title=metier width=3533 height=4818 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/metier-2-65f1d131e8015.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MAX FARAGO</span></p><img alt=metier title=metier width=4492 height=6126 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/metier-3-65f1d131a471a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MAX FARAGO</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I wanted to create a bag that was as beautiful as it was functional,” Morris says. “Something that could reflect your taste while also being your perfect companion. When a day is hectic and busy, your bag – which carefully houses all your belongings – is your port in the storm. I wanted to make the journey more enjoyable.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The idea initially was to replace that second bag that everyone is forced to carry. You know the one she means – most of us head out for the day with both a nice handbag and a grubby tote filled with everything we actually need. Morris wanted to meet form with function and create bags that would tick both off.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The label's bigger styles, including the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://metier.com/products/incognito-large-cabas-suede-chocolate data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Large Incognito" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Large Incognito</a> (which is perfect for the office) and the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://metier.com/products/market-weekend-bag-suede-marrakech data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Market Weekend" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Market Weekend</a> (which is great for overnight stays) – have become particular favourites, but Métier also has an array of smaller styles too, like the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://metier.com/collections/roma-shoulder-bag data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Roma class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Roma</a> or the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://metier.com/collections/the-minimalist data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Minimalist class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Minimalist</a>, which are still designed with practicality in mind.</p><img alt=metier title=metier width=4492 height=6738 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/metier-4-65f1d13154110.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MAX FARAGO</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Design at its core is to solve a problem or answer a need, but the luxury version of this is to do it in the most perfect way possible,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">No detail goes unnoticed. From hidden magnet pockets (which make it easier to retrieve your phone or keys) to padded handles for comfort, detachable, adjustable straps and even rounded bases for a more comfortable wear, these bags are designed to fit better into a busy woman’s life than an ordinary handbag. Morris says she truly wants to make her customers’ lives easier, but with designs that are beautiful.</p><img alt=metier title=metier width=4492 height=6738 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/metier-5-65f1d1dce5607.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MAX FARAGO</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Part of this is making sure that they have all the information they need about what bag will be best for them. As well as super detailed information on its website, Métier works very closely with customers to help them choose the perfect piece in store. According to Morris, clients spend around two hours choosing a handbag in the London flagship – this is not a rushed decision. “Launching Métier with our London flagship was one of the best decisions we made,” she says. “It is so powerful to have an anchor where people can come and be immersed in a world you have created.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s no denying that these bags are an investment. With prices ranging between £950 and £3,500, they’re not affordable as such. But, these are designed to be passed down through the generations, and are certainly not one-season wonders. Plus, although understated, Métier’s designs have caught the eye of some of the most stylish women in the world. They have been spotted on the arm of A-listers and royalty, and have become a firm favourite with fashion editors. The Princess of Wales, Katie Holmes, Nicole Kidman and Alexa Chung are all fans, while one of the totes even featured on an episode of Succession. Further proof if you weren’t yet convinced about the brand’s Quiet Luxury credentials.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Diane Kruger: Inside my beauty bag" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-imbb-dk-1-65e881f05c6ac.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSud3yQcXBrb2JkuqbAyJ6pZpqRnMBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
