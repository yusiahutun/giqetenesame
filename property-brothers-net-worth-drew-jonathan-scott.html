You simply can’t miss them—and all that ubiquity means they’ve had a ton of financial success over the years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/home-design/a35549/property-brothers-facts/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Scott brothers" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Scott brothers</a> were entrepreneurs from a young age, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/getting-started/2018/04/17/drew-scott-property-brothers-how-became-house-flipper/519902002/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="USA Today" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">USA Today</a>. They started their first business, making and selling decorative hangers, at just age 7. (They called their business <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.glamour.com/story/10-amazing-secrets-about-hgtvs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="JAM Enterprises" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">JAM Enterprises</a>, which stood for Jon, Andrew, Mom.) After that, they worked as clowns for the local parks and recreation department, and then got into acting. They starred in the Canadian TV series Breaker High, and they individually had <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.glamour.com/story/10-amazing-secrets-about-hgtvs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="small roles" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">small roles</a> on TV shows like Smallville, where Jonathan was Tom Welling’s body double, and The X Files. And at some point in the ‘90s, they both worked as mall cops, Drew told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hgtvs-property-brothers-25-things-you-dont-know-about-us-w475246/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="US Weekly" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">US Weekly</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">But then, they caught the real estate bug. They assumed the mortgage and paid a $250 down payment on a $200,000 house, flipped it, and made a $50,000 profit. They realized it could be a profitable business, so Drew became a real estate agent, Jonathan studied real estate design, and they worked on their company, Scott Real Estate. Jonathan even spent time designing illusions for magicians, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.glamour.com/story/10-amazing-secrets-about-hgtvs data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Glamour class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Glamour</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.housebeautiful.com/lifestyle/g19831878/who-are-the-property-brothers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Drew was the first to get an offer to host a show" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Drew was the first to get an offer to host a show</a>, a Canadian project called Realtor Idol that never got off the ground. But that defunct show led the show’s producers to develop Property Brothers. These days, they help people buy and renovate houses on their several Property Brothers shows on HGTV, from Buying and Selling to Brother vs. Brother to Drew’s Honeymoon House.</p><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">They also design furniture and home decorations through Scott Living, make new shows and movies through Scott Brothers Entertainment, where they collaborate with their brother JD, and work on their digital startup GuruHub.tv.
