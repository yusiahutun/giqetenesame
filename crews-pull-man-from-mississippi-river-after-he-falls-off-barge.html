to Trinity Muscatine for treatment.</p><p>Battalion Chief Ted Hillard indicated training in these types of rescues proved to be valuable.</p><p>“This was one of those low-frequency but high-risk events that we train for,” said Hillard. “There was a lot of wind, which made the effort difficult, but our personnel did a great job.”</p><p>According to a news release, Muscatine County Search & Rescue also responded to the call and had two boats in the water, which were recalled after Muscatine Fire had the victim back on shore.</p><p>The Muscatine County Sheriff’s Department and the Muscatine County Police Department also provided assistance during the rescue.</p><p>This was the second major call on-duty staff responded to Sunday — the first one involving a <strong><a href=#>fire at the Muscatine Tower Apartments</a></strong>.</p><p class=postsid
