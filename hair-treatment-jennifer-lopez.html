No matter what you do, sometimes it feels like you’re finding more hair on surfaces than on your actual head. But you’re not alone, even A-list celebrities like Jennifer Lopez struggle to thicken their hair. Recently, Lopez shared her secret hair treatment to preventing hair loss — and it’s only $15!</p><p>“When I was coming up, I didn’t know how to take proper care of my hair when I first started working in television and film,” Lopez explained on an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram post</a> for the brand <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow"><strong>Hers</strong></a>. “I had to learn about <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">minoxidil</a></strong> from my hairstylist! And I’ve been using it ever since.” (<a href=#>Her favorite sunscreen</a> is a bargain, too!)</p><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Hers Minoxidil</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/01/Untitled-design-2.png><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy on Hers ($15)</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Celebrity-approved</li><li>Promotes hair growth</li><li>Replaces old hair with new, stronger strands</li></ul><p>This <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">hair treatment</a></strong> by Hers will give your hair a natural lift. The deep conditioning formula was made with two percent minoxidil, which is a topical solution normally used to help replenish hair loss. (And, it’s J. Lo-approved!)</p><p>Minoxidil stimulates your scalp, encouraging the shedding of weak strands and actively promoting the growth of stronger, thicker tresses. Over time, this results in a healthier, more a lustrous head of hair.</p><p>Whether you’re actively losing hair or your locks feel dry and brittle, minoxidil can help! Just apply 1 ml of the product onto your scalp twice a day and make sure it stays on for at least four hours before you wash your hair.</p><p>One reviewer raved at the “spa-like results,” saying she “saw new hair growth within a week of use. My hair seems like it has filled in and gotten thicker and richer since I have been using the Hers products. Honestly, I didn’t expect much in the beginning, but I am now convinced!”</p><a class=block-product__cta href=#>buy now<span class=block-product__cta-icon></span></a><p>Both Lopez and reviewers can’t get enough of this hair treatment. Lopez loves the results so much, she even became a spokesperson for the brand. Refresh your beauty routine to include <strong><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">minoxidil</a></strong> (along with one of <a href=# rel=noopener>the best brushes for thinning hair</a>), and you could soon have a healthier, fuller head of hair than you ever dreamed was possible!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJoqqGnoKW2r7OOoZiiql2pv6at06acp6xdn7KvusifnKtlnKS9psY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
