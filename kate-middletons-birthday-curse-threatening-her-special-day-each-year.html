From the antics of her brother-in-law <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and his wife to Omid Scobie’s controversial book released late last year, the now 42-year-old hasn’t been able to have peace on her special day. However, it seems this year she might get to alongside her husband <a href=#>Prince William</a>, and other loved ones. But while <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> celebrates, let’s look back at the few turbulent years she has suffered.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1401932365-774x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-announce-they-are-stepping-down-from-the-royal-family>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announce they are stepping down from the royal family</h2><p>In 2020, Kate Middleton’s birthday curse began. On January 9, 2020, Harry and his wife, <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>, announced they were leaving The Firm. They took to their <a href=#>Instagram</a> to share the news, and it must’ve hurt the future queen as she was celebrating her 38th birthday and overshadowed her celebrations completely.</p><p>In the post, which <a href=#>shocked the rest of Harry’s family</a>, the couple penned how they were starting a “new chapter” and thanked the “community” they had built on the platform.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle’s feud ‘affected Harry’s relationship’</a></p><p>Royal correspondent and body language expert Kate Micholl claimed two months later Kate was taking it “badly.”</p><p>Kate <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “To be honest, I think Kate has taken it all badly. She, Harry, and William were once such a happy trio. She thinks what has happened is all very sad.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-world-shuts-down>The world shuts down</h2><p>Two years later, the Kate Middleton birthday curse arose again, this time in the form of a lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was a big birthday year for both Kate and William, as they were turning 40.</p><p>There were reportedly meant to be celebrations held by the late <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth</a>, but because of the measures, it never happened.</p><p>On being in lockdown, Kate <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: ‘I think as parents you’ve the day-to-day elements of being a parent, but I suppose during lockdown we have had to take on additional roles that perhaps others in our communities, or in our lives, would have perhaps supported us and helped us with.”</p><p>She continued by saying she had cut her three children’s hair and had begun to teach them after schools were shut down. However, she admitted she too felt “exhausted.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-two-books-with-suspicious-release-dates>Two books with suspicious release dates</h2><p>On January 9 last year, 39-year-old Harry published his memoir Spare on Kate Middleton’s birthday, igniting the curse once again. It completely overshadowed her special day, especially with some of the things he had written and claims he had made.</p><p>According to a source, Kate was “appalled” by what her husband’s brother had said about her. They <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> US Weekly: “Kate feels that Harry’s actions are atrocious. She is appalled at him for dragging her name through the dirt and is finding it hard to forgive.”</p><p>Then, as this birthday draws closer, there’s been another bombshell. In November 2023 royal author <a href=#>Omid Scobie published his book Endgame</a>, and it was full of many explosive claims and accusations. The princess was “saddened” by what was written and is allegedly not willing to reconcile with her in-laws. It is said to have further damaged <a href=#>the already temperamental</a> relationship she had with Harry and Meghan.</p><p>“This has closed the door on any reconciliation with Meghan as far as Kate is concerned,” the insider went on,” they <a href=# rel=nofollow>explained</a>. “She has had enough of Meghan’s antics and wants absolutely nothing to do with her. She will never make up with her.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Kate Middleton’s terrible gift from Prince William ‘didn’t go down well’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WGcLfArZxmpZmZsa2x06ilrGWSnr%2B1tMOasGabpafApnnToamemaSau6q6xmafnqpdqL2mr8iao2acka56pq3CoWSynZGnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
