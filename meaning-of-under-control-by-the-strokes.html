The lyrics seem to express a desire to break free from societal constraints and expectations, and instead embrace a more carefree and uninhibited existence. The song explores themes of rebellion, individuality, and the fleeting nature of youth.One standout lyric in the song is "We worked hard, darling." This line taps into the notion that individuals often feel pressured to conform and live according to the standards set by society. However, the use of the term "darling" adds a personal touch, suggesting that the speaker is addressing a loved one or someone close to them. This lyric can be interpreted as an acknowledgment of the efforts made to fit in and meet societal expectations, but also a recognition of the strain it puts on personal identity and the desire to break free from such constraints.Another impactful lyric is "We were young, darling, we don't have no control." This lyric highlights the fleeting nature of youth and the desire to live in the moment without worrying about societal judgment or expectations. The repetition of "don't have no control" emphasizes the rejection of constraints and the idea of living life on one's terms. It speaks to a desire to embrace spontaneity and not be burdened by the pressures of conforming to societal norms."I don't want to give it to you, your way" is another line that stands out. It expresses a rebellion against being boxed into someone else's expectations. It suggests a refusal to conform and a desire to be true to oneself. This lyric embodies the theme of individuality and the rejection of external control or influence.The line "I just want to watch you go by" carries multiple layers of meaning. On the surface, it seems like a simple statement of observing someone as they pass by. However, it can also be seen as a metaphorical representation of the speaker's desire to not be tied down or controlled by another person. It suggests a reluctance to conform to societal expectations placed upon relationships.Despite having a strong emphasis on rebellion and breaking free from control, the song also incorporates a sense of longing for acceptance and assurance. The lyric, "I just want to know you're alright; you are young, darling, for now, but not for long," reveals a desire to connect with someone and ensure their well-being. It acknowledges the transience of youth and the need for emotional support, even when rejecting societal control.As a whole, "Under Control" speaks to the universal desire for self-expression and individuality. It explores the tension between conforming to societal expectations and embracing personal identity. The song encourages listeners to break free from the constraints of society, embrace their true selves, and live in the present moment, knowing that youth is fleeting.Overall, "Under Control" is a thought-provoking song that presents imaginative and unexpected themes. It examines the struggle to maintain autonomy and authenticity in a world that often tries to exert control. Through its lyrics, the song encourages listeners to challenge societal norms and live life on their own terms, even if it means relinquishing control and embracing uncertainty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufony1tMRmqq2qn6CytHvMnpinoZ6cerCyjK6lnZ2iYrCwutOrpqVlkq56tbTEZqqtqp%2BgsrQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
