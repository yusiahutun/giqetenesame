But have you also thought about how it could hurt your teeth?</p><p>Coffee might feel necessary to help you function, but it can also wreck havoc on your mouth over time. Luckily, knowing how — and when — to care for your teeth can make a difference.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is coffee harmful to teeth?</h2><p>While it might taste delicious and give you an energy boost, coffee can also create an acidic breeding ground for bacteria in your mouth, which can lead to tooth decay and enamel erosion with long-term consumption.</p><p>Moreover, coffee <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">contains tannins</a>, which are molecules that cause color compounds to stick to teeth and give off that off-white or yellow color. Even one cup of <a href=#>coffee</a> can stain teeth, but over time it leads to more noticeable discoloration.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When’s the best time to brush your teeth when you’re drinking coffee?</h2><p>While experts say that not drinking <a href=#>coffee</a> at all would be ideal for tooth health, skipping that cup o’ Joe may not feel like an option for many people.</p><p>If you want to get that morning mug in but don’t want to see as many adverse effects on your teeth, experts recommend brushing your teeth before you drink. It may seem counterintuitive, but it cleans your teeth and also acts as a barrier to protect your enamel beforehand. Think of it as a preventative measure.</p><p>Meanwhile, giving your teeth a brush after drinking coffee <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">could actually further weaken</a> your enamel and also cause those stains to stay put for even longer. If you want something to do after your cup of coffee, just <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">swish water</a> around in your mouth before rinsing in the sink. Otherwise, your saliva, which is pH-neutral, will take care of those coffee chemicals within a half hour.</p><p>Making sure you get a good brush in before every cup of coffee may seem like a lot, but that beats having teeth issues down the line!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ5Oks6exxGarnp2knXqjvtSsn6Kmlw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
