He divulged,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“I once talked on my blog about the seven words to describe an ideal relationship: Never stop trying to impress your partner. If you can both stay in that place, when you really want to show the best of yourselves to each other, relationships can become such a powerful team. I love the idea of relationships as being the ultimate team - someone you share everything with, who completely and utterly backs you, and whom you give to completely unselfishly. It’s easier said than done, but we all need something to aspire to.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>That is the warm words about relationship any woman would instantly fall.
