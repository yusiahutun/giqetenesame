He not only amazes us with his voice but does it more often with his impersonation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The famed career, along with&nbsp;recherche outlook, apparently makes people think that Zachary is having dating affairs. But does that seriously hold in the case of the young actor's life? Let's know all that while we have a thorough look at his life.</p><h2>Zachery's Glorious Journey To Success:</h2><p>Zachery Gordon was born on February 15, 1998, in Oak Park, California, where his Jewish parents Linda and Ken Gordon raised him along with his two brothers Kayle and Josh Gordon.</p><p>The little Zachery's early interest in acting led him to his first television role in How I Met Your Mother, where he <a href=# rel=follow>appeared alongside famous actors like Josh Radnor</a> and Neil Patrick Harris. After that, the roles kept being offered to him one after another. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For his splendid acting skills, he also received a Young Artist Award for the 2007 movie 'Georgia Rule' in 2008.</p><a data-i-framely-url="//cdn.i-frame.ly/api/i-frame?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F128362363683%2Fphotos%2Fa.128368508683%2F128368858683&key=94a32d1cd689480351ad0174cc9774ec" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/128362363683/photos/a.128368508683/128368858683</a><p>Zachery began growing as a good-looking teenager, and the transformation was apparently&nbsp;visible in his later projects like Last Man Standing, Diary Of A Wimpy Kid movie series, Pete's Christmas and Dead of Summer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>In due course, he got into rumors to have<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> hooked up </a>with <a href=# rel=follow>Bailee Madison</a>.

Moreover, he has always been good with girls and enjoys&nbsp;their company. He also makes them part of his social media posts&nbsp;often. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In 2015, October 15, he took to his Facebook to wish a friend on her birthday.</p><a data-i-framely-url="//cdn.i-frame.ly/api/i-frame?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F128362363683%2Fphotos%2Fa.259798258683%2F10153649620013684%2F&key=94a32d1cd689480351ad0174cc9774ec" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/128362363683/photos/a.259798258683/10153649620013684/</a><p>The next year in 2016, we saw him creating happy moments with a girl in a prom.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><a data-i-framely-url="//cdn.i-frame.ly/api/i-frame?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F128362363683%2Fphotos%2Fa.259798258683%2F10154179563358684&key=94a32d1cd689480351ad0174cc9774ec" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/128362363683/photos/a.259798258683/10154179563358684</a><p>Despite him having a lot of&nbsp;girlfriends, he hasn't made&nbsp;disclosure of his relationship with any of them yet and is supposedly single. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Zachary is an&nbsp;appealing guy, who got blessed with an exquisite look and a great physique. No wonder he has a lot of female fan following. His look&nbsp;in one of his Instagram posts was a total attention seeker, as he went shirtless.</p><p>While girls&nbsp;have already begun falling for this handsome teenager, Zachary seems to be keeping a distance from datings and focusing on his career.</p><p>Recently, at the mid of Mar&nbsp;2017, he took to the official Twitter account of 'The Diary of a Wimpy Kid' to share a video, which was indirectly an approval of the cast for the new version of the series called The Long Haul. He passed on his the opportunity to Drucker Jason!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>From one Wimpy Kid to another, watch as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@ZacharyGordon</a> passes the torch to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@Drucker_Jason</a> & the Diary of a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#WimpyKid</a>: The Long Haul cast! <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/Htqowb4aNj</a> â€” Diary of a Wimpy Kid (@wimpykidmovie) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">March 16, 2017</a></p><p>Through the video, he said that the project is special for him and is excited to see new cast members in the movie. He even conveyed a sweet message of passing on the torch for Jason Drucker, who will be starring as Greg Heffley in the new edition.</p><p>The young actor, who enjoys a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> of $2 million, has no any project in his bag for now. Hopefully, this talented lad's future has a lot of good work in store for us. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><a href=# rel=follow>Stay with us</a> for further updates on Zachary Gordon!</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZrOZk52us8WMoKarnJ%2Bjeqi10aWdq6GVo7FusMCtoKefXai1qr7TpZysq12jvLh5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpeZFpaHBlnaTDqrHSZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
