That's weird. Meat first thing in the morning. No good."</p><p>So Golding asked the audience, "Is that like a morning thing to do for New Yorkers?" Immediately, Clarkson and the studio audience told him, "No."</p><p>"Okay, so that's a faux pas?" Golding clarified. "Dammit! I just felt like a pastrami sandwich."</p><p>But his faux pas was nothing compared to what came out of the American Idol winner's mouth after he questioned whether "meat first thing in the morning" was no good.</p><p>"Well, steak and eggs," Clarkson replied. "Yeah, I don't mind meat in the morning." She then tried to change the topic, but only got a couple of words in when her brain realized what she had just said.</p><p>Without another word, the talk show host was on her feet with her hands over her head. She bee-lined straight for the camera, and away from Golding, before slowly making her way back.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3fc0dee3-480c-4dbe-81f1-5f252d99617f data-container-ref=toofab:article:e5b216dc-e2b1-43b6-8987-fa322fc53b2b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/59/5by4/2024/01/03/59818500b59a496abef47bd4bb3430b5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kelly Clarkson's Ex Brandon Blackstock Told Her She Wasn't 'Sexy' Enough to Be on The Voice</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Seeing the embarrassment on her face, Golding quipped, "Oh dear. We gotta get a fan for you, Kelly. You look a little hot under the collar."</p><p>"I mean, are you serious? Those are the words I used?" Clarkson said, looking toward the audience instead of at her guest. "I was like, 'Did I just say that?'"</p><p>She then added with a wry smile, "It's not a bad thing though," before finally moving on.</p><p>Clarkson has been enjoying a new lease on her newly-single life since her divorce from Brandon Blackstock and relocation (bringing her talk show with her) from Los Angeles to New York. It's also been a healthy journey, with the singer getting noticeably more fit.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1b03ea89-6e4d-4e5e-8071-2a85a5690174 data-container-ref=toofab:article:e5b216dc-e2b1-43b6-8987-fa322fc53b2b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c0/5by4/2024/01/31/c0f132f04f7845d6acd357275d38825b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kelly Clarkson Reveals 'Pre-Diabetic' Diagnosis, Says It Prompted Her to Lose Weight</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In January, guest Kevin James told her she looked "great," which prompted Clarkson to <a href=#><strong>open up a bit</strong></a> about why she was slimming down and focusing more on her health.</p><p>"Well, I was told I was pre-diabetic. That was literally what happened. They were like -- and I was like, well, I wasn't shocked," Clarkson shared. "I was a tiny bit overweight. But I wasn't shocked by it. They did, they were like, 'You're pre-diabetic. You're right on the borderline.' I was like, â€˜But I'm not there yet.'"</p><p>It still took her two additional years, and the move to New York, before she fully took her health into her own hands, determining it was time to do something about it.</p><a id=gallery-link-b2661746-4c99-4e81-99d3-743554979a0b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:b2661746-4c99-4e81-99d3-743554979a0b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:e5b216dc-e2b1-43b6-8987-fa322fc53b2b data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/33/4by3/2024/04/17/33355b6567b141e08ed788b8e3527d5c_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21manBfoLKtuNhmmqWZoqDAsLqMsJilo6NivKeyjKyrmp%2BVYq6nwMSrZJqbk56xprrTmqNmnJmnwbp5zJ6YrWWapLimedaiq6FlmJq7s8WMoKalnJmjtHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
