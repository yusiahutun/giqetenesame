He told CNN: "She'd be pickled if she drank that much. <strong>All I said was she likes a gin and Dubonnet. That's her favourite drink."</strong> And the chef clarified that Her Majesty doesn't drink every day. "She doesn't wake up in the morning and have a large gin and tonic."</p><p id=e6l8NC982F_C data-wc=35>Darren added that when the Queen does have a drink with dinner it is typically a glass of her favourite German sweet wine.
