It was the fifth time he had survived a suicide bid.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'It's the sort of situation normally associated with religious cults,' defence barrister Michael Poll told the Court of First Instance, adding the five adult members opted for suicide, because 'they could not cope with the pressures of modern life.' With no money left for food the next day, three-year-old Chin-pong and his sister On-yee, four, were fed milk spiked with sleeping pills so they would not suffer when the gas took effect.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their parents, half-brother and two uncles had decided the pair should not live as orphans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although the flat had been made airtight, Chan said the children knew nothing of the plan, because 'they might be scared if told they were going to die'.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mr Poll described Chan, an immigrant from Fujian, as 'an affectionate, kind and loving husband, one who was devoted to his children'.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'He hears the voices of his loved ones asking why he hasn't followed them,' Mr Poll said, adding the former factory worker prays for death and was horrified when he awoke in hospital.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Weeping, Chan yesterday admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Mr Justice Michael Wong Kin-chow sentenced him to an indefinite stay at Siu Lam psychiatric centre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The court heard how on September 22, the family bought sleeping pills and a rubber hose. They sealed the windows, doors and air-conditioners of the flat in Tai Yuan House, Tsuen Wan Centre, with plastic bags and adhesive tape.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The final decision was made the following day over supper.
