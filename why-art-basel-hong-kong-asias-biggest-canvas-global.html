Another work is both a nod to, and a rejection of, Picasso’s flower paintings, in a challenge to perceptions of nature.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">This city – like so many other things in Asia – cannot be measured by European standards, even though it was exposed to British influence for a long period of timeNeo Rauch</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am looking forward to seeing how my appropriation of the minimalism of Asian philosophy finds its way back to the audience,” Zobernig says. “On one hand, the influence of Asian art was very important for the development of avant-garde European art more than a hundred years ago. On the other hand, there was very little continuity in the abstract tendencies in the Asian world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“People from Asia prefer paintings in general, but we also need to balance those preferences out with our rigorous and more conceptually-driven programme,” Lee says about selecting artists to carry to the Asia market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Most of the artists we show in Hong Kong are mid-career … We have found that this promotes a healthier dialogue surrounding art and gives us more freedom in determining who and what we show.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is not news that galleries are utilising the influential stage of Art Basel Hong Kong to introduce artists to the region. Since 2015, David Zwirner gallery has staged special presentations of artists at their Art Basel booth every year, including Neo Rauch, Michaël Borremans, Luc Tuymans, Jeff Koons and Carol Bove.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We bring the artists to Hong Kong to meet the clients here in person, which is very important,” says Zwirner. “Art Basel Hong Kong has always been a crucial platform for us to introduce the artists and our global programme.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">German artist Neo Rauch is giving his first solo presentation in Asia, an adventure made possible by Zwirner’s gallery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They expressed their desire to show my paintings in this extremely interesting city – and I did not hesitate for a second to accommodate this wish,” Rauch says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This city – like so many other things in Asia – cannot be measured by European standards, even though it was exposed to British influence for a long period of time.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">In Asia and in Hong Kong, it’s such a small scene; people here are looking for works that speak to a global audience – not just a Chinese audience, not a gimmick …Simon Lee</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rauch admits that at first sight, he found Hong Kong’s familiar historical European cityscapes rather disorienting. But this first impression was quickly replaced by a fascination with the city’s vibrant energy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“One can sense the driving forces of economic prosperity almost physically,” says Rauch. “What surprises me [the most] is the nearly complete rejection of the architectural past in favour of a seemingly unfettered highly dynamic urban expansion.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both Lee and Zwirner consider Art Basel a good vehicle for introducing new artists to the region, yet also decided to put up solo exhibitions of the artists they represent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“An art fair has its limitations as you can only show a certain number of works for a few days, but with our gallery space at H Queen’s, we can put up comprehensive solo exhibitions of our artists,” Zwirner says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
