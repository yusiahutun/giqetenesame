And you may think a lot of time you're the last thing on my mind, but that isn't true. You're always the first thing. I know videoing and brainstorming, and coming up with ideas for projects get in the way, along with the music and everything. But, still, baby girl, you are always in the front of my mind, with your beautiful face smiling and when I lay down with you at night, and when we're just backroad cruising or even when we're just sight-seeing spending time with each other those are the times, I will cherish forever. And I know sometimes you think I don't care, but I'm only working hard for the little Upchurch's w will have one day. And the life we will have one day we're old and grey. I love you, sweetie, always and forever.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5b72af4c5bfbe9d2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is Chris Morocco married?

They started dating in 2020 and engaged after a couple of months, on July 10, 2020. Ryan shared a lovely image with his fiancé flaunting a diamond ring with the following now-deleted caption:</p>Simply, thank you for letting me be exactly who I am and not trying to make me something I'm not. You make me feel normal in a world where I don't feel normal most of the time. Thank you for everything you do for me day in and day out. You really are my best friend & I am thankful that I'm about to marry you and be happy for the rest of my life…I love you with all my heart.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0bf4342c17f2a948.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How did Flip from Street Outlaws die?

It did not take long for the couple to tie the knot. They married on September 18, 2020. So, are they still together?</p><p class=align-left>There are rumours that Ryan Upchurch is no longer together with his wife. The story came about because the couple went low-key after tying the knot. However, what captured people's attention and quelled the rumours of separation even more, was that they both deleted images they had previously posted for one another.</p><p class=align-left>Ryan Upchurch even stopped following Taylor <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">on Instagram</a>, which is quite weird. Also, on Valentine, the duo did not do any special uploads on their respective social media accounts. Taylor posted a video of her daughter on her Instagram at some point. She asked her followers not to ask her questions about her relationship with Ryan Upchurch.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/845448f4b52a4f6f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trending celebrity news: Diamond Platnumz, Willy Paul, Lupita Nyongo, Lilian Muli & More</span></p></a>Please don’t ask if Ryan and I are still together. This post is about my child.<p class=align-left>Even though all the evidence points toward separation, the two have never confirmed the rumours, and there are still indications that they might be together. Nothing can be said unless the rapper or his wife talks about it. Therefore, as it stands, Ryan Upchurch’s wife and kid are still in his life.</p><p class=align-left>Ryan Upchurch and Brianna Vanvleet were in a relationship and even engaged in 2016. However, it didn't go past the engagement, and they went their separate ways shortly after. The rapper went ahead to marry Taylor Smith. However, people wonder if they are still together considering their low-key nature, which is quite strange.</p><p class=align-left>Are you looking for more information about Lisa Ann Russell and Jeff Probst's relationship? <a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> featured an <a href=#>informative article</a> about the couple that has sparked great interest within the online community.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/40a636e0187c2596.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=#><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Boys cast and photos</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Many people have been wondering about the couple's story.
