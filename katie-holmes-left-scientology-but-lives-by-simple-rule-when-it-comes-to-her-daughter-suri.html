The Batman star has revealed she likes to keep her grounded, despite having parents who are big names in showbiz.</strong></p><p>The Dawson’s Creek alum was previously married to <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>, but the duo split in 2012 after six years of marriage. Katie Holmes shares daughter Suri with the Mission Impossible star as they co-parent the youngster, who has now turned 18.

So we are always doing that. I don’t over-gift.</p><p>“I don’t inundate my child with a lot of things.”</p><p>Despite the <a href=#>TV</a> alum’s bank balance, she hasn’t spoiled her daughter over the years.</p><p>She also spilled to InStyle: “I love her so much. My biggest goal has been to nurture her into her individuality.</p><p>“To makes sure she is 100 per cent herself and strong, confident, and able. And to know it”.</p><p>Cruise and Holmes’ daughter Suri is set to head off to college this fall, and it’s believe she’ll be able to see mom Katie regularly if she chooses colleges in the city over traveling further afield.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hollywood-duo-s-relationship-timeline>Hollywood duo’s relationship timeline</h2><p>Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes met in 2005, but growing up, she already had a crush on the film star.</p><p>“I’m going to marry him one day,” she says she told her sisters back in a Seventeen interview in October 2004. She was engaged to Chris Klein at the time, but it didn’t end up working out either.</p><p>Cruise spoke to Katie’s manager, saying there was a potential role for her to star in Mission Impossible: III, with the duo hitting it off.</p><p>They became another hot relationship in <a href=#>Hollywood</a> when they were spotted in public together the following year. The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> tied the knot in 2006, and welcomed Suri in the April.</p><p>However, it wasn’t written in the stars as they broke it off six years later, with reports claiming <a href=#>Scientology</a> was part of the decision. Cruise is a dedicated Scientologist, and Katie joined the religion when they were together. Insiders claimed the starlet didn’t want to raise their daughter in the religion, so she left and divorced the Top Gun star.</p><p>According to divorce papers, Katie Holmes was given ‘sole custody’ of Suri, and Tom paid her $400,000 in child support until she turned 18 years old.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2eCcLfAraCeZZikua6x0majnp6kYsCktcSnq6ikn5zGbq7UrWSloaaawG6u2GaqoqWgobJuvtSlnGavmJq7brXTZpqopZWoerW7jKGcq2WUlsKotNOeqWarpae2cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
