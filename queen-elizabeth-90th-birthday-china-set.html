And it turns out that when it comes to commemorating key events in her life, the final word on design goes to the monarch herself.</p><p id=eCNlMR1HAuLU data-wc=53><strong>Ian Grant</strong>, production controller for the Royal Collection Trust, told <strong>HELLO!</strong>: "The products are always shown to the member of the Royal Family in whose honor they are made before we go into production with that range, because it's very personal and we want to make sure it reflects their wishes and desires.</p><p style=text-align:center id=eL0Q6ZTC6Beb><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>CLICK ON PHOTOS FOR FULL GALLERY</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e2c011a17163-body53-z.jpg> <strong>The detailing on every piece in the set is magnificent.</strong><p id=eriTsKgxhCrK data-wc=30>"We tend to really work and work a design until we're 100 percent satisfied that it's appropriate. It's very, very rare that they say we don't like it at all!"</p><p id=eMlAzQbpwM-6 data-wc=33>"We have received comments in the past and we have always acted on those comments, but I'm happy to say that when the Queen saw the 90th birthday china, she was very pleased."</p><p id=evij5WV47aPb data-wc=28>He added: "When <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince George</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Charlotte</a> were born, we presented the china to the <a class=hm-link href=#>Duke</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Duchess</a> of Cambridge and they were given the 'Number One' pieces of each of the ranges."</p><p id=e4GfWmmKfqlv data-wc=42>Intricately designed in shades of blue and burnished gold, the 90th birthday range includes a $47 mug, a $55 pillbox, a tankard and 6in side plate at $75 each, a teacup and saucer at $105 and a large 10in plate at $170.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/65f3990b0d29-body53-z.jpg> <strong>Each piece is hand-crafted using traditional techniques.</strong><p id=eQe2_vuUpk8V data-wc=20>A limited edition range featuring charger plates, loving cups and other pieces will go on sale in the coming months.</p><p id=eZ9peGJsMabz data-wc=19>Profits go back into preserving the Royal Collection, which is held in trust by the Sovereign for the nation.</p><p id=e1wBbklr0TH7 data-wc=47>Each piece has a unique design to complement the rest of the range but all feature the Royal Arms encircled by ribbons tied in a bow and surrounded by garlands of roses, shamrocks and thistles, the national emblems, which appear on the Queen's official coat of arms.</p><p id=eybhXyEpL4zX data-wc=23>Roses and forget-me-nots, which traditionally bloom in April around her actual birthday, appear alongside cornflowers, which bloom around her official birthday in June.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/073f94e3c2e1-body35-z.jpg> <strong>A teacup and saucer will cost approximately $105.</strong><p id=eKKPaFOUGIAh data-wc=51>Many of the pieces are edged with a "partridge-eye" pattern inspired by antique Sèvres porcelain in the State Apartments at Buckingham Palace. Ian said: "There is a lot of hidden meaning behind the design. We think very carefully about the event we are celebrating and the individual to whom it refers.</p><p id=eXnsIdvpTrCv data-wc=18>"If you look back at the Diamond Jubilee, Coronation, longest reigning monarch, those three ranges are quite formal.</p><p id=e8qb_eew0X8e data-wc=33>"This time we thought, this is about Her Majesty The Queen, we wanted a different take. We wanted to develop something much more personal, with a lighter touch and lighter feel to it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/85ec0fc27cf4-body35-z.jpg> <strong>The set is locally-made in England.</strong><p id=eVkcoIKMize5 data-wc=39>"And the back stamp says Made in England, which is vitally important to us." From design to dispatch, each exquisitely produced piece passes through at least 50 pairs of hands at around eight different factories in the Stoke-on-Trent area.</p><p id=ezEPHN_B1Qql data-wc=24>It can take up to a year for the designs to be finalized and reproduced on lithographic transfers known as decals using silk-screen printing.</p><p id=e7wFMowo1KOQ data-wc=37>Meanwhile bone china slip is poured into individual plaster of Paris molds to create the basic shape and rough edges and seams are removed before the item is fired, hand dipped in lead-free glaze and fired again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f746728b0c34-body35-z.jpg> <strong>Here is a closer look at the beautiful pieces.</strong><p id=eEoEzPXRZJKD data-wc=21>After an inspection, each piece is decorated using decals before a third firing, another inspection and hand-gilding with burnished 22ct gold.</p><p id=eaRGz3f7f-Dk data-wc=41>A final inspection takes place after a fourth firing and the approved item is wrapped in tissue paper – embossed with a floral design used in the silk damask wall hangings at Clarence House – and placed in a gift box.</p><p id=ey0hMvEIPvCX data-wc=43>Peter Walpole, 42, Director of Pollyanna, one of several factories producing the range, said: "It's such a privilege to be able to make the products. We can't compete with offshore factories because of legislation, but it's more of a high-end, niche, specialist product.</p><p id=e0NI8d6yfNWs data-wc=31>"That Made in England stamp is so vital to us and overseas visitors see a great value in it – not just in ceramics, but in fashion, food and other products."</p><p id=e6ZNQo0dynY0 data-wc=30>The Staffordshire Potteries have been at the heart of the UK ceramics industry for more than 300 years, but only 10,000 of the once 80,000-strong workforce remain in the business.</p><p id=em4e-Z5il14E data-wc=10><strong>WATCH FOR AN IN-DEPTH LOOK INTO THE CHINA SET PROCESS:</strong></p><p id=eNhhW4zYR6NH data-wc=30>Over the past 23 years, the Royal Collection Trust has commissioned some three million pieces of china from the area, helping to preserve traditional skills and keep companies in business.</p><p id=e7AzpLZwHKcs data-wc=39>Ian explained: "These great people and great skills are only here in Stoke and we're proud of our association with it. We are quite a big part of their business, indirectly we probably employ 80-100 people in the area.</p><p id=ePo6CYcjUSzZ data-wc=48>"Profits go back in to pay for the preservation and conservation of the art held in trust by the Queen for us all. The potteries in Staffordshire help to pay for that history and we are helping to pay for the skills that otherwise might have been lost."</p><p id=e-3liBuvj3Zv data-wc=22>The set is on sale from March 1 at Royal Collection Trust shops in London, Edinburgh and Windsor and online at: .</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfp7y6rcutsGhqYGaDcX%2BPam1xcWdufLLBxJ6lZp2cnseirsStn2ZxYKm1bq7Iq6uhnJGueqS0yKeYZquVqXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
