For example, we love keeping up with trend and putting outfits together. We hate when brands don't make our size, or make it but only show their clothes on one body type letting the rest of us guess what a garment might look like on someone like us. The lack of representation of different body types has been an issue for a long time, and a slightly less discussed group that's often left out are folks who might identify as in-betweeners.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For some reason, those who fall somewhere in the middle of the clothing-size spectrum — maybe they wear mediums and larges, or hit the far end of straight sizing without fitting into "plus" — tend to get looked over. How often do we browse a site and see clothing on someone who's a size 8 or 10? Or spot a mid-size model on the runway? It's rare, and yes, it's weird, especially since a good amount of people fall into this category.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thankfully, there are plenty of influencers out there who don't mind picking up the slack. They express their personal style, share <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shopping recommendations</a> and fashion hacks, and provide plenty of outfit ideas for anyone else who falls in between those elusive model body types of "sample" and "curve." So, if you've ever wondered "but, what will that look like on me?!" while checking out the latest designs, here are eight mid-size women you should follow, ASAP.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-noelle-downing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Noelle Downing</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why You Should Follow Her:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Downing isn't afraid to be honest, talking openly about self-love and body positivity. She always has cute and budget-friendly clothing recommendations, too, whether you're in search of some classic denim, a flattering swimsuit, or a matching loungewear set.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-courtney-quinn></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Courtney Quinn</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why You Should Follow Her:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Color! Puff sleeves! Tulle! There's so much whimsy going on in Quinn's wardrobe, and she makes the most outrageous designs seem completely wearable. She clearly has fun putting together her outfits, and her combinations are so creative, they almost qualify as works of art.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-holly-ah-thion></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Holly Ah-Thion</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why You Should Follow Her:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not only does UK-based Ah-Thion highlight that she's mid-size in her bio, she's also petite, which presents its own set of struggles when it comes to finding clothes that fit (ugh, long pants). Still, she completely nails every '90s- and '00s-inspired trend, and is ahead of the game on new ones, showing us how to pull off everything from pully tops to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>big collars</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kristle-lauren></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kristle Lauren</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why You Should Follow Her:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes, influencers pose in pieces that feel a bit too extreme and over-the-top for everyday wear, but that's where Kristle comes in. She knows how to make the most of simple basics, creating completely wearable yet fashion-forward outfits that'll work for whatever you have planned.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-abi-nunn></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Abi Nunn</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why You Should Follow Her:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Do you love prints? And color? And want fashion formulas that are quick and easy but not boring? Then you might find yourself captivated by all the cool, vibrant outfits on Nunn's IG. She'll show you simple swaps that'll fully transform your own ensembles, such as trading black leggings for a shiny pink pair, and doesn't shy away from embracing nostalgic trends, whether it's a cardigan set or a baguette bag.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lois-opoku></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lois Opoku</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why You Should Follow Her:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So much of what Opoku wears can be described with one word: versatility. While she definitely has a set style, full of structured items, prints, and bits of leather, many of her outfits would work for a variety of scenarios, whether it's a dressy date night or a day at the office.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-charlotte-emily-price></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Charlotte Emily Price</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why You Should Follow Her:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Price has really found that sweet spot between cute and comfortable, often finding ways to elevate your average <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>oversized shirt</a> and pair of sweats. But, on top of sharing her top-notch outfit ideas (along with sexy lingerie picks!), she's also spoken out about toxic positivity, reminding people it's impossible to feel confident and great about our looks 24/7, while suggesting a goal of body neutrality instead.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-chloe-pavlou></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Chloe Pavlou</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why You Should Follow Her:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A quick scroll through Pavlou's pictures and you'll find she really excels at styling one piece in particular: The classic graphic tee. Her best outfits prove this piece can be layered in multiple ways, paired with almost any bottom, and amped up with accessories. You'll definitely start to see your own collection in a whole new light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3y0wNGenK1lo6nGrbGOoqWbnaSssqa6xKtkpqGUYsCqxsRmnZqrmJ68r3nIp52lrZWjsKa%2B0g%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
