A year ago, the tight end wowed audiences as <a href=#>he hosted SNL</a>, something that was a ‘dream come true’ for the star. Now, it looks like we may be seeing him on our screens even more. However, some fans fear his ‘farewell season’ may be on the horizon.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1535307316-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-in-talks-to-host-are-you-smarter-than-a-fifth-grader-reboot-sources-claim>Travis Kelce ‘in talks to host Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader? reboot’, sources claim</h2><p>The Kansas City tight end is ‘in talks’ to host the show for Amazon currently, Deadline <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a>. Sources tell the publication that “there are conversations but a deal is not yet closed.”</p><p>They state that this “could also depend on his availability given that he appears ready to suit up for the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> champions for another season.”</p><p>As well as his <a href=#>TV</a> appearance on SNL, the star also hosted dating show Catching Kelce for the USA Network, during his bachelor days. Maya Benberry of Kentucky won Kelce’s heart and the former <a href=#>couple</a> went on to date for a few months in 2016 before calling it quits.</p><p>Although the rumors from sources have not been confirmed, of course, they have X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a> going wild, and bringing up Kelce’s <a href=#>hilarious old tweets</a>.</p><p>“When the question is to spell squirrel and the 5th graders and Travis are both sweating,” joked one. Of course, they were referring to the 2011 tweet, recently unearthed by Swiftie detectives, which read: “I just gave a squirle a piece of bread, and it straight smashed all of it!!!!</p><p>“I had no idea they ate bread like that!! Haha #crazy.” Yes, that was supposed to say squirrel.</p><p>“Shouldn’t he be a contestant first,” laughed another.</p><p>Others thought the rumors meant he was ‘ready to be done’ from the NFL, as one tweeted: “Trav definitely ready to be done with the NFL. Farewell season.”</p><p>His older brother, <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a> emotionally <a href=#>announced his retirement</a> in March after an incredible 13 years with the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>Amazon has not commented on any rumors, so we guess we’ll just have to wait and see if Trav appears on our screens with a bunch of fifth-graders!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-nfl-star-enjoys-his-time-off-with-taylor-swift>The NFL star ‘enjoys his time off’ with Taylor Swift</h2><p>Undoubtedly one of the busiest couples in the world, both Trav and Taylor have had a mammoth few months with the Super Bowl, and the <a href=#>music</a> star trotting around the globe with her Eras Tour.</p><p>However, the two now both have a rare block of time off, and it looks like they may be living it near the sun, sea, and sand, as <a href=#>celebrity</a> gossip account Deux Moi sourced a few pics. Sources say they’re in the Bahamas, but no official confirmation from the couple.</p><p>Earlier this month, sources revealed that the two were having a break from their busy schedules on the West Coast.</p><p>“They’re focused on rest and recuperation and relaxing at home and having low-key and chill time together,” a source <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> US Weekly. “They are enjoying movie nights in her home theater, catching up on films and shows they’ve missed.”</p><p>They’re just like us!
