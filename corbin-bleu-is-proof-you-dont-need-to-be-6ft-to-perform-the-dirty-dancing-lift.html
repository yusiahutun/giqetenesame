Now, he’s bringing those skills to <a href=#>FOX</a>‘s new show The Real Dirty Dancing…</strong></p><p>The reality competition sees a host of celebrities try to get their groove on, by partnering up and attempting to re-create classic scenes from the original film – including the legendary lift.</p><p>For those who have already seen the iconic movie (if you haven’t, where have you been?!), you’ll know that the well-known Dirty Dancing lift requires some serious muscle, balance and height.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>So when Corbin showcased his moves on the first episode, many began to question just how tall he is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/02/GettyImages-1169848384-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-corbin-bleu-s-height>Corbin Bleu’s height</h2><p>Corbin Bleu may not be over 6 foot, but he showed that he can definitely do a lift or two on The Real Dirty Dancing. In fact, the actor and dancer is 5 ft 9, proving that you don’t need to be a certain height to do the lift.</p><p>Okay, so he may have had the help of co-stars Howie Borough, Tyler Cameron, and Antonio Gates when lifting Cat Cora, when they reconducted that water scene where Johnny lifts Baby in the air.</p><p>However, Corbin showed his strengths even more when he lifted Cat – who revealed on the show that she has never danced before – into the air during their dance in The Barn.</p><p>So, let’s forget the stigma that height has any kind of influence on whether that lift can be done!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>just found out that seungkwan and dino have the same height as corbin bleu and that they're 1cm taller than zac efron and 4 cm taller than lucas grabeel 👀<a href=#>@pledis_17</a></p>— coke zero can't calm me down 💋 (@sebongtomii) <a href=#>May 23, 2021</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fox-fans-react-to-corbin-s-moves-spoilers>FOX fans react to Corbin’s moves: Spoilers</h2><p>When Corbin joined The Real Dirty Dancing line-up, viewers had already pinned their high hopes on him as becoming the potential winner of the new FOX show. He was paired with Cat during the first episode.</p><p>A fan wrote to him on <a href=#>Twitter</a>: “I honestly thought you were going to win this round. You deserved it. Rooting for you anyway cause you’re SO talented it’s crazy.“</p><p>Another <a href=#>said</a>: “Corbin honestly deserved to win, he was amazing. <a href=#>#TheRealDirtyDancing</a>.”</p><p>“I still think Corbin is the best Johnny.

The dancer’s song “I Don’t Dance” ironically landed in the Top 70 of the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>He is actually trained in dancing at the Debbie Allen Dance Academy and attended the&nbsp;Fiorello H.
