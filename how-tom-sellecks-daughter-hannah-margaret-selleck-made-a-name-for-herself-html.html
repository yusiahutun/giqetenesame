She doesn’t compete on the screen for Emmys and Oscars; instead, she competes on horseback, and she has won multiple medals for such since choosing to go down this career path.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_17>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Blue Bloods’ Star, Tom Selleck Opens Up About Taking a Break From Fame After ‘Magnum P.I.’</a></p><h2>Hannah Margaret Selleck: The road becoming a champion horseback rider&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_50>Hannah never desired the glamour tied to a life in the spotlight, at least not in the Hollywood sense, as <a href=#>News.Amomama</a> notes. She began training on horseback at a young age. Selleck stayed in school, yet her free time was spent at the Foxfield Riding School in Westlake Village, California.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_47>Selleck began learning the tricks of the trade at Foxfield at 16 years old.

She also won medals the same year at the Platinum Performance / U.S. Equestrian Federation.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_54>Though she kept competing at the amateur level, and a career in horseback riding looked promising, she still chose to enroll in college (as opposed to skipping out on the four-year education). She studied at Loyola Marymount University, which led to a brief change of heart before she found herself back on the saddle.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><h2>Hannah Margaret Selleck tried PR on for size&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-8_40>Hannah Margaret Selleck received a Communications degree while studying at Loyola Marymount.
