We know that years of dealing with our mood swings, coming to our sports games (even when we were just bench warmers), and grappling with teen angst can't be summed up into one day of the year, but the least we can do is give her some well-deserved TLC. Whether she likes <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g1173/mothers-day-brunch/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="breakfast in bed" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">breakfast in bed</a> or prefers a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/shopping/gifts/g19601989/mothers-day-gifts-from-daughter/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gift that's meaningful" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">gift that's meaningful</a>, the experience of pure relaxation is a love language we all share.

We rounded up some awesome spa specials and deals to help you celebrate that special mother figure in your life without breaking the bank. With these specials, you may even want to make it an appointment for two *wink wink*. Before booking, we suggest calling your local location ahead of time to determine their hours of operation and if they're participating in the Mother's Day special. Also, if you don't happen to see a spa near you on the list, grab a gift card from your local spa because any massage or facial is better than none at all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Brighten up mom's day with the gift of a relaxing facial.
