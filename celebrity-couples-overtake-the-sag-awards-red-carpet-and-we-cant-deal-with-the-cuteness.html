We take a look at our favorite <a href=#>celebrity couples</a> from the 30th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-margot-robbie-amp-tom-ackerley>Margot Robbie & Tom Ackerley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2028795025-717x1024.jpg><p>Of course, we had to start with <a href=#>Barbie</a> superstar, Margot Robbie and her husband Tom Ackerly. The celebrity couple complimented each other at the SAG Awards in black outfits, but the Australian actress added a pop of pink to continue the Barbie theme.</p><p>She stunned in a Schiaparelli Couture mini dress with a statement bright pink shoulder detail that trailed down the red carpet. Honestly, looked perfect for a good nap at the end of the night.</p><p>There were no <a href=#>inappropriate moments between the couple</a> on this red carpet, unlike the Gotham Film Awards, but they looked adorable as always.</p><p>Couple goals!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-america-ferrera-and-ryan-piers-williams>America Ferrera and Ryan Piers Williams</h2><p>Continuing the Barbie party, America Ferrara and her husband looked as wholesome as ever as they took to the carpet.</p><p>Once again, they match in black, although just like Margot, America added a pop of color in the form of some white organza sleeves.</p><p>On the Red Carpet, the 39-year-old said the dress felt like a “princess fairytale moment,” and by the way they looked at each other, after more than a decade of marriage, it looks like her relationship is too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-omar-sy-amp-helene-sy>Omar Sy & Hélène Sy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2028794689-683x1024.jpg><p>The French actor looked dapper as ever as he took to the SAG carpet with his wife, Hélène Sy. The actor has recently had audiences gripped around the world in Netflix series Lupin, so it was only right he shined for the Netflix debut.</p><p>Coordination must be a theme with the couples, as yet again, we see another. Omar looked smart in a black tux and white suit but added a hint of shine with a gold collar piece.</p><p>Hélène stuck to the black and white theme with a monochrome dress and again added a pop of color with a flowery bag.</p><p>The award for the most effortlessly cool couple goes to them!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-russell-wilson-amp-ciara>Russell Wilson & Ciara</h2><p>Special shout out to the queen, Ciara, who stunned on her first Red Carpet since giving birth two months ago.</p><p>The <a href=#>music</a> star showed off her amazing post-baby body in a latex look with a slit thigh that had all eyes on her.</p><p><a href=#>Ciara and Russell Wilson</a>, who looked dapper in a tux had a baby free date night at the show, and they deserved and rocked it!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-downey-jr-amp-susan-downey>Robert Downey Jr. & Susan Downey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2036441318-683x1024.jpg><p>On his award-winning streak, Robert Downey Jr took home the Outstanding Actor In A Supporting Role during the SAGs, for his role in <a href=#>Oppenheimer</a>, and he was doing it in style.</p><p>His unique fashion sense did not disappoint, as he didn’t just wear a normal blazer. Instead, he stood out with two long flaps of fabric that hung down longer than the rest of the suit. Underneath, he opted for a neutral crinkled shirt.</p><p>Film producer Susan Downey also stunned with a sparkly silver gown, showing off her toned figure.</p><p>Most stylish couple goes to them!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alexandra-hedison-amp-jodie-foster>Alexandra Hedison & Jodie Foster</h2><p>Last but certainly not least, we have <a href=#>Jodie Foster</a> and Alexandra Hedison who co-ordinated in all black as they’re set to celebrate their tenth anniversary later this year.</p><p>Foster opted for a sleeveless gown with sequins, whereas her partner opted for a different look, covering her plunging black dress with an open blazer.</p><p>The two were all smiles as they posed for the cameras, and they complimented each other perfectly.
