But Veronica is best known as the mother of American professional basketball player Devin Booker. He plays for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association and is the youngest player ever to score 50 points in a row.</p><p>As the mother of a famous son, Veronica’s life is constantly under scrutiny. Many want to know about her career, married life, husband, and other interesting details about her.</p><p>Join us to get to know her better.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Veronica Gutierrez is the Mother of Devin Booker</strong></h2><p>As we mentioned before, Veronica is the mother of NBA player Devin Booker. She became famous after her son Devin became the Phoenix Suns’ number 13 pick in the first round of the 2015 NBA Draft.</p><p>In case you didn’t know, Booker has achieved huge success as a basketball player in a very short space of time. Just about 2 years after joining the Suns, the youngster became the youngest player to score more than 60 points in a single game. In March 2019, Booker also became the youngest player to score 50 points in consecutive games. After all, the son of Veronika Gutierrez also received his first NBA All-Star Game selection in 2020.</p><p>Mother-son duo Veronica and Devin have a great relationship. In fact, Devin often shares photos of his mum on his Instagram profile. In one of his Instagram posts on 8 May 2016, the basketball player expressed his feelings for his mum Veronika and what his mum means to him.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jane Fonda’s First Daughter Vanessa Vadim – Early Life, Marriage, Divorce, Children, and Career</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Veronica Gutierrez Has Three Children Including Devin</strong></h2><p>The beautiful Veronica has three children, Devin Booker, Davon Wade, and Mia Powell. Devon is the eldest of her three children and was born on 17 February 1993. Unfortunately, she has not disclosed any details about Davon’s father.</p><p>Devin is the second child and he was born on 30 October 1996 in Grand Rapids, MI.

And they are also all quite successful in their own fields.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Veronica Gutierrez Never Married: Was In A Relationship With Melvin Booker</strong></h2><p>Devin Booker’s parents, Veronica and Melvin, were never married. The couple’s decision to remain unmarried was more a result of their busy schedules and commitment to work. Melvin, who is also a former professional basketball player, often had to move to different places, so they had no choice but to have an unconventional relationship.</p><p>In fact, Veronica and Melvin’s children had to share time with both parents. Now Melvin often recognizes Veronica as the best partner and mum and appreciates her sacrifices for her children. In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Undefeated</a>, Melvin stated, “Veronica was very important because she was very devoted to Veronica’s family,</p><p>She made it happen. I owe her all the credit for allowing that to happen. Ever since [Devin] was 8 months old, he was coming with me in the summertime. It was special. I was trying to make up for the times I missed when I was gone.</p><p>Although Veronica is not married to her partner or boyfriend Melvin, they have had a great relationship together for a long time. They first met in 1995 when Melvin was playing for the Grand Rapids Mackers in the 1995-1996 CBA season.</p><p>Then, their first meeting quickly turns into a romantic relationship. In fact, after only a few months of dating, Gutierrez became pregnant with Melvin’s child Devin. But unfortunately, the relationship fell apart, which led to divorce.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Veronica Gutierrez Dating or Single at Present?</strong></h2><p>After her divorce from Melvin, Veronica entered into a relationship with a new boyfriend. Unfortunately, she never revealed his identity. As for her relationship status in 2021, things are a bit unclear.</p><p>There is no proper information on whether Veronica Gutierrez is married to a man or dating someone. For the time being, it is safe to say that Devin Booker’s mother is single and not dating.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What is Her Nationality? Gutierrez is Mexican-American</strong></h2><p>Not many people know, but Veronica, who is a beautician by profession, is Mexican-American by nationality and of Puerto Rican descent. She was reportedly born in Puerto Rico, but her father is from Los Nogales, Mexico, a town near Texas.</p><p>Despite her Mexican heritage, Veronica unwittingly kept her children, especially Devin, away from that culture. In fact, her son<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Devin once declared</a> that he only became closer to his Latin American heritage after he arrived in Phoenix in 2015, shortly after playing at the University of Kentucky.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Inty Miller?
