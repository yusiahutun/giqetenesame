The show also stars Alberto Guerra, Christian Tappan, Martín Rodríguez, Juliana Aidén Martinez, Vanessa Ferlito, and Karol G making her on-screen debut.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jimmy-chelsea-back-together-love-is-blind.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-is-blind-gold-cups.png><p>“Most of the people know of Griselda as the ruthless, violent drug lord that she was,” Vergara said in a press release. “So we were very careful not to glorify her in the series. But we also wanted to take time to uncover the deeper story of Griselda, how beyond all odds, a poor uneducated woman from Colombia managed to create a massive, multi-billion dollar empire in a male-dominated industry, in a country that was not her own, through tactics that she devised that were both ingenious and cruel. The truth is that, as much as Griselda broke down barriers, she’s definitely not a hero and she should not be idolized.”</p><p>She continued, “So, what I loved about the project was getting to explore Griselda’s origin story, the making of a monster. When you then look at someone like June, a mother trying to fight a male-dominated culture in her workplace, I think more than <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1702129/aaron-quinn-now/>drawing a comparison,</a> you see more and more why Griselda’s self-justification is so wrong. Griselda and June are different sides of the same coin, the two different paths a person can take in order to take care of their family.”</p><p>So how was Griselda Blanco caught?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-was-griselda-blanco-caught>How was Griselda Blanco caught?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/griselda.jpg><p>Griselda Blanco was caught in Irvine, California on February 17, 1985, after she was tracked by DEA agents for about ten years. According to The United States v. Blanco, Blanco gave a false name to the DEA agents who arrested her, and she was found to be carrying false identification papers. While compared to the show, Griselda called the authorities to arrest her.</p><p>“She was pretty tough and standoffish, a typical Colombian move I would say, nonchalant, not really showing any real emotion, but when we put her in the car, I was in the backseat with her, and the other agent was driving. We drove up to Los Angeles, and when we got close to the courthouse is when she became visibly shaken,” retired Agent Bob Palombo told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/griselda-blanco-sofia-vergara-netflix-b2051670.html rel=nofollow>The Independent.</a> “I mean, visibly shaken, she was shaking, and she grabbed my arm and you could feel her shaking and she turned and she threw up on my shoulder. Not a lot, it was mostly just bile, but she knew the proverbial s*** had hit the fan. And it was time for her to meet her accusers.”</p><p>Blanco was charged with conspiring to manufacture, import, and distribute cocaine. She was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. While serving her sentence, she was additionally charged with three counts of first-degree murder by the state of Florida. She narrowly escaped the death penalty on a technicality when her right-hand man Jorge “Rivi” Ayala was discredited as a witness after being caught having phone sex with secretaries in the prosecutors’ office. Blanco pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, to run concurrently.</p><p>She was released in 2004 due to her health issues, and suffered a heart attack in prison in 2002. Blanco was deported back to Medellín, Colombia where she reportedly<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1689480/gypsy-rose-husband/> lived a quiet life</a>. She was killed on September 3, 2012, in same assassination style that she was often credited with—shot down by two assassins on a motorcycle. “She wasn’t hiding. Not at all,” Palombo said. She was killed at the marketplace, the butcher shop, and according to my sources, she lived a well-respected life in the community. She was supposedly very benevolent to the downtrodden and that may have been a reason that a lot of people didn’t bother with her.”</p><p>Days before the premiere of the Netflix show, Michael Corleone, identified as Michael Sepulvedablanco in the lawsuit documents, and his wife, Marie, are seeking damages “in excess of $50,000,” as well as an emergency temporary injunction to block the January 25 release of&nbsp;Griselda.</p><p>Michael accuses the show’s creators of using his unreleased “artistic literary work” and his likeness “to depict the life story of himself and his mother, Griselda Blanco De Trujillo” without permission or credit, according to the lawsuit obtained by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Tonight.</a></p><p>The family made a statement to the site: “It is beyond dispute that Griselda Blanco made the ultimate decision for Michael Blanco, her son, to carry out and benefit from her life as it relates to artistic and literary productions based on her story. Although Michael Blanco is a public figure himself with his own rights to publicity, Mr. Blanco continues to honor his mother’s executed intent. Since 2008, Michael Blanco has worked extremely hard in the entertainment industry where he conducted numerous interviews and tv shows to tell his story. He is also the outstanding author of the book entitled, “My Mother, the Godmother and the True Story of Michael Corleone Blanco the Son of Griselda Blanco.” He published this book in an attempt to fulfill his mother’s wishes and tell the world the intimate details about his life and that of his mother, Griselda Blanco. It is a compelling story.</p><p>Michael Blanco was more than willing to share his hard work and the nonpublic details of his mother’s life with Latin World Entertainment/Netflix if he was to be fairly compensated. Make no mistake, Michael Blanco is humble and thrilled each and every time someone reaches out to shine light on his mother and the Blanco family. However, in the case of Netflix/Latin World Entertainment, the Defendants approached Michael Blanco to gain his work, perspective, and insight to only turn around and act like he does not exist, in an apparent attempt to reap their own profits. It is disappointing that Latin World Entertainment/Netflix would pretend that it is acceptable to use Michael Blanco’s commercial work without his permission.”</p><p>In a statement to DailyMail, he explained his&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>reasoning for legal action</a>, “I feel that it’s my duty to do it. And if I didn’t, I wouldn’t be keeping my word to my OG, to my mother. I’m just holding it down for the family – and I’m doing it legally.”</p><p>He continued, ‘I am a history buff so I believe that history should be told not only by the victors, but by the losers. You can call me what you want but I’m in both worlds. Some people will say, ‘You’re glorifying the lifestyle’. I glorify my mother but when you read my book and you’ll see my public apology to the masses, and to the victims of the 1970s and 1980s cocaine and crack wars. I’m apologetic because I myself am a victim… I buried 22 members of my family. I survived countless assassination’s attempts. Look at the way I lost my mother.”</p><p><strong>Griselda is now streaming on Netflix.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_16ad4f.png><p>A profile of bloodthirsty Colombian drug dealer Griselda Blanco, known as the “Black Widow” due to her penchant for killing off her lovers, recounts <a data-pmc-sp-product=ac48495d7ea88daa3005e7dce76204d6 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Blanco’s vicious crime spree","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"The Godmother: The True Story of the Hunt for the Most Bloodthirsty Female Criminal in Our Time","id":"0671701932","category":"True Crime"},"id":1703427,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Blanco’s vicious crime spree</a> and the ten-year struggle to bring her to justice. Court records and interviews with Drug Enforcement Administration agents, federal attorneys, Miami police and Blanco’s acquaintances flesh out a portrait of a ruthless cocaine wholesaler whose “mules” (couriers) transported drugs in women’s undergarments and shoe heels. Her propensity for violence was legendary: she bragged of murdering her husband and claimed responsibility for Miami’s “Dadeland Massacre,” a shootout in a mall parking lot that disposed of one of Blanco’s creditors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK6sMLInqpoaWdlgHV%2BlmifqK9dnL%2Bqv8Slm5plkqGur6%2FOZpqarZedwXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
