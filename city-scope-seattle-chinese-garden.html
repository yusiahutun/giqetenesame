And with craftsmen from Chongqing, rocks from Lake Tai, in the Yangtze River Delta, and peonies from Luoyang, Henan province, it is finally coming together.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This labour of love began as the United States west coast city reached across the Pacific to build ties with China. In 1979, one of the first non-government trade associations focused on China was founded here. When Chongqing and Seattle became sister cities, in 1983, horticulturist Phil Wood started pondering how this rapport should be represented.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We figured a garden would be a good way to do it," says Wood, who has adopted a daughter from China and served as board president for the Seattle Chinese Garden.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After securing a 1.8-hectare plot on a college campus, Wood and others launched a fundraising campaign for the construction of a pavilion. In addition to the needed cash, more eclectic donations came their way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Huge rocks from Lake Tai were shipped in from Suzhou, in Jiangsu province, pro bono by someone who was then a port commissioner. Scholars' rocks are a signature landscape feature in most traditional Chinese gardens. A bronze carp sculpture, hand-cast in the early 20th century as a tribute to a Chinese general, was shipped in from Thailand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chongqing city government was also eager to lend a hand - or 42, to be precise: attached to 21 skilled craftsmen. In 2010, the Sichuanese crew built the Knowing the Spring Courtyard, with tile-crowned walls, latticework windows and black pebble mosaic flooring, under the supervision of Chu Yangming, an art historian who now lives in Beijing. For the courtyard's opening ceremony, a fire-department permit was approved and firecrackers were let off on an auspicious day last August.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And a garden wouldn't be complete without flowers. The board struck gold when Jiang Yiqiao, a native of the peony's famous home, Luoyang, came forth from a Seattle suburb. The son of a painter of peonies, he ensured his adopted hometown would get native plants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In late 2012, 232 Luoyang tree and shrub peonies of more than 19 varieties were jetted into Seattle. A month ago, the garden hosted its second annual peony festival.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fundraising continues apace to fully realise the garden's plans, which include a 23-metre-tall pagoda, a teahouse on a lotus pond and two more pavilions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Hopefully, our increasing relationship with China will lead to more interest in supporting this garden," says Wood.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Blossoming relationship</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOmqmtoZOhsnB9lGtscW1hZLCqwNhmqpynoJp6tLHAraulnV2Ytaq6xKycZp%2BRp7Gmug%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
