Out of all your available options, manuscript assessments provide the most well-rounded advice, if you’re willing to invest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are several popular companies offering their expert opinion on your work. Before submitting anything, take a look at what each accepts and provides. At the same time, make sure you’re at a stage in your writing that will benefit the most from such in-depth feedback.</p><h2 id=what-are-manuscript-assessment-services>What Are Manuscript Assessment Services?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/text-marked-with-red-pen.jpg><p>Literary consultancies, creative writing schools, and even independent professionals offer online assessments at different prices. What you get from all of them is a detailed report, breaking down the expert reader’s take on your work, good and bad.</p><p>At the end of the day, you’ll know where you stand in terms of character development, plot, pace, style, and so on. The report can also include tips on how to improve the manuscript—not just its contents, but its potential as a published book too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most manuscript assessment services don't offer proofreading or similar line-by-line editing, however. That’s not what they’re about. For this kind of feedback, it’s best to turn to a copyeditor.</p><h2 id=the-literary-consultancy>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Literary Consultancy</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-literary-consultancy-manuscript-assessment-services.png><p>Established in 1996, The Literary Consultancy (TLC) was among the first UK literary companies to support writers with manuscript assessments. So, you can be sure of its experience in the field, as well as its high standards.</p><p>It recruits distinguished editors and writers, who are then matched to submissions based on their expertise. The company also has contacts in many sectors of the publishing industry and can put you in touch with the right people, if your manuscript is ready.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of types of works, TLC welcomes:</p><ul><li>Fiction</li><li>Short Stories</li><li>Illustrated children’s fiction</li><li>Poetry</li><li>Scripts and screenplays</li><li>Non-fiction</li></ul><p>Depending on the size of the manuscript, the cost can range from just under $150 to over $500. To avoid wasting money, submit only when you feel you absolutely need to and decide exactly what you want to know about your work.</p><h2 id=faber-academy>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Faber Academy</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/faber-academy-manuscript-assessment-services.png><p>This is another highly recommended company with prestigious links to the publishing industry. Based in the offices of Faber & Faber, the Academy is a creative writing hub that will take your needs very seriously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once again, the pool of experts is diverse enough to meet submission demands. These experts cover all fiction and non-fiction genres. The service is known to find readers even for very specialized manuscripts.</p><p>Faber Academy offers different reports and prices, depending on what kind of assessment you want. Is it a work in progress or a completed draft? Or are you ready to submit to an agent and need feedback on your synopsis, cover letter, and extract?</p><p>Expect to spend at least $300 and up to around $700, if not more in the case of works over 100,000 words. Despite the cost, it’s a service that should sit at the top of your list of candidates.</p><h2 id=jericho-writers>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jericho Writers</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/jericho-writers-manuscript-assessment-services.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you’d rather go for a smaller company, Jericho Writers is a good choice. Harry Bingham, acclaimed crime writer, established it in 2004 to help authors through video courses, online events, editing services, and more.</p><p>For a manuscript assessment, it accepts all genres and lengths. You’ll get a report, the chance to talk to your reader, and, if your work is good enough, help with finding an agent. If you want line-by-line editing, you can arrange something separately.</p><p>The cost is no less steep than high-end consultancies, so be sure you’re ready for an assessment. For up to 20,000 words, the minimum price is $491. For a massive manuscript of over 150,000 words, it’ll be more than $1,500.</p><p>One silver lining is that members get discounts. You can join for an annual or monthly fee and enjoy a lot more than personalized feedback.</p><h2 id=daniel-goldsmith-associates>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Goldsmith Associates</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/daniel-goldsmith-associates-manuscript-assessment-services.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While only slightly cheaper than other top options, the service has a few extra perks that might interest you. Keep in mind, however, that Daniel Goldsmith Associates only accepts completed manuscripts.</p><p>If you want to submit to them, finish your work and keep editing until you can tweak no more. You can find handy tools for this job on most word processors, as well as alternative solutions like <a href=#>Reedsy’s multifunctional writing and editing feature</a>.</p><p>A suitable expert will take on your manuscript, whether it’s fiction or non-fiction. You'll get a secure account to track the assessment’s progress and have a better idea of when to expect the final report.</p><p>The least you can look forward to is a detailed analysis of your work’s structure and advice on what steps to take next. But Daniel Goldsmith Associates also offers to submit and back your perfected manuscript to an agent or publisher for free.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The assessments themselves do come at a price, though. A short story or picture book will cost you around $250. A novel of up to 30,000 words is $400. For a longer work, plan for a bigger budget.</p><h2 id=writerful-books>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Writerful Books</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/writerful-books-manuscript-assessment-services.png><p>Here’s another example of a small consultancy with a lot to offer. If you’re an indie author, for example, with a limited budget and lots of questions about the quality of your work, Writerful Books is the way to go.</p><p>Your assessment report will be supportive and very thorough. The company’s members are also sensitivity&nbsp;readers. They can pay special attention to problems of culture, racism, sexism, and so on. The clearer you are about your needs, the better you can utilize the tools available to you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Writerful Books doesn't accept all manuscripts, however. In terms of non-fiction, it only handles memoirs and narratives. On the fiction side, only submit your work if it’s in the following genres:</p><ul><li>Contemporary</li><li>Young adult</li><li>Historical</li><li>Literary</li><li>Christian</li></ul><p>A major plus with this service is the low cost. The fee is $5.50 per 1,000 words, which puts a manuscript of 100,000 words at no more than $550. This is especially good for authors with a big book on their hands.</p><p>A budget-friendly price lets you use your leftover cash for other services, like copyediting and marketing. Make sure to make the most of <a href=#>budgeting apps and their finance tools</a>&nbsp;as well, so you have plenty of money to spend on your book.</p><h2 id=the-oxford-editors>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Oxford Editors</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/the-oxford-editors-manuscript-assessment-services.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Writers on a budget actually have lots of services to choose from.

It's the result of experienced authors coming together to help up-and-coming writers tackle this difficult industry.</p><p>It accepts all fiction and non-fiction, as well as poetry, scripts, and screenplays. Your assigned reader will analyze and then happily discuss your work. And, once again, if the manuscript ticks all the boxes of a successful publication, your reader just might land you an agent.</p><p>Fees are reasonable too. The cost of assessing a full-length book will fall somewhere between $270 and $880, while a short story should be $200 at most. There are discounts too, if you buy a bunch of services in one go or if you’re a returning customer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=choose-manuscript-assessment-services-wisely>Choose Manuscript Assessment Services Wisely</h2><p>It’s tempting to go for the cream of the crop, but don’t ignore lesser-known companies.
