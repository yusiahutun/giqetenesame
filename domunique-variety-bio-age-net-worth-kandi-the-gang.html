The show explores the drama in Atlanta-based restaurant Old Lady Gang (OLG), and the owner of the restaurant is Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kandi Burruss.</p><p>The new show has been the talk of the town for its peculiar nature of including members of the LGBTQ+ community as a cast who also happens to be Kandi’s employees.</p><p>Dom’Unique is the self-proclaimed “day one” bartender at OLG and dancer who has performed with Kandi on the “Welcome to the Dungeon” Tour and even with the hot girl, Megan Thee Stallion.

Dom’s close with her workplace besties, Torin and Shawndreca, and her budding flirtationship with a co-worker is becoming the talk of OLG.</p><p>A few viewers watched the show one viewer complained, “that bartender with her hair swinging all over the fruit is a NO for me”.</p><p>On 20 January 2022, Dom,’Unique announced on her Instagram, “Wowwwww!!!
