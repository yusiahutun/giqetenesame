With each look she reveals, just when you’re thinking, “This one can’t possibly be better than the last,” she pulls out yet another. Last night, for her fifth appearance on Saturday Night Live, she pulled out four.</p><img alt="new york, ny february 03 jennifer lopez is seen on february 03, 2024 in new york city photo by damebkbauer griffingc images" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York - February 03, 2024" width=2327 height=3100 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1976106287-65bfa91a3e573.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">DAMEBK/Bauer-Griffin</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Right off the bat, the “On the Floor” hitmaker set the glamorous tone for the evening, arriving at New York City’s 30 Rockefeller Plaza, where the sketch-comedy show is filmed, in a sheer black mock-neck top over a nude bra tucked into floor-grazing, wide-leg slate-gray trousers. Over the top, she wore a long light-gray vest coat that featured a belt on the interior and dramatic lapels. For an unexpected pop of color, Lopez added bright teal leather opera gloves, and of course, finished everything off with some bling in the form of a wide gold choker and thin-framed purple-tinted sunglasses. She rounded off the look by wearing her signature bronzy glam with a sultry smoky eye and nude lip, and styling her caramel tresses in soft, voluminous waves.</p><img alt="a person singing into a microphone" title="a person singing into a microphone" width=1170 height=2067 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-0877-65bfa976ec596.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">courtesy of Saturday Night Live via Instagram</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Once inside, the Hustlers star continued to raise the stakes. For her performance of “Can’t Get Enough,” Lopez broke all the rules of businesswear, donning black wide-legged trousers that featured a V-shaped waistline and sexy deep cutouts on each hip. She paired the pants with an equally daring top by FROLOV: a white button-up shirt that was cropped all the way into a bra, featuring a plunging, unbuttoned neckline and defined cups, which she layered with an inky black cropped blazer. She kept her locks down, and they blew majestically as she danced.</p><img alt="a person in a pink dress" title="a person in a pink dress" width=1170 height=2072 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-0878-65bfa99254139.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">courtesy of Saturday Night Live via Instagram</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She followed the act by winking to her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a46537787/jennifer-lopez-outfits-couture-week-2024/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Couture Week looks" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Couture Week looks</u></a>, debuting new song “This Is Me … Now” in a dress that looked like actual art. J.Lo was breathtakingly beautiful in a grand, off-the-shoulder gown composed completely of pale pink roses and wispy white feathers. The dreamy Nicole + Felicia piece featured a trailing, floor-sweeping skirt with a heart-racing leg slit that went up to her hip and large, bushy sleeves. To let the centerpiece shine even more, she pulled her hair back into a low, slicked-back bun. Although we don’t know whether these flowers were real (as they were on her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/preview/celebrity/latest/a46487135/jennifer-lopez-white-rose-petal-coat-tights-schiaparelli-show-paris/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="white Schiaparelli coat" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">white Schiaparelli coat</a>), it is certain this dress is the perfect embodiment of the love and self-healing she sings about on her new track.</p><img alt="new york, new york february 04 jennifer lopez is seen in midtown on february 04, 2024 in new york city photo by gothamgc images" title="Jennifer Lopez Stuns in Four Grand Looks for “SNL”" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1984377812-65bfa93876dd2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Gotham</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lopez finished off the night—and her impromptu fashion show—with the most J.Lo look.
