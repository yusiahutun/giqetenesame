That’s because on Monday morning, four local barbers volunteered their time to provide complimentary haircuts to students.</p><p>Barbers Richard Brown, Cameron Evans, Adrian Powe and Elliot Cooley set up shop in the high school’s second-floor science lab and welcomed more than a dozen young men to take a seat in their makeshift barber chairs.</p><p>And the free haircut was not the only gift they shared.</p><p>“When they get in my chair, we are going to talk about what they are doing in their life,” Brown said. “We want to take the opportunity to say things that will put them on the right track.”</p><p>Powe added, “It is good for the young men to see people willing to help. Pouring our lives into them and just a chance for them to see positive men impart some knowledge.”</p><p>Several of the students were wearing hoodies and covering up their heads, so the idea was to offer free haircuts in an effort to promote self-esteem and compliance with school standards, Laurel High School Assistant Principal Crystal Tucker said.</p><p>“We simply called our local barbers, and they said ‘yes’ without hesitation,” she said. “We made it available and were able to schedule several once we received their parental consent.”</p><p>Brown has been taking his traveling barber shop to local schools and organizations for more than 40 years and has owned and operated Hair World in Laurel since 1982. He and the others plan to set up shop at the Laurel Housing Authority next.</p><p>“I (as a young man) said that one day when I grew up, I was going to make a difference wherever I can,” Brown said. “It just so happens that I am a barber and God has blessed me, so I am thankful to be able to give back.”</p><p>Student Rayquan Gardner was appreciative of his time in the chair.</p><p>“It means they care about us and how we look and present ourselves,” Gardner said. “I talked with my barber (Evans) about how I am doing in school and my goal to pursue photography.”</p><p>Gardner said Evans invited him to come to his barber shop and practice his skills with the camera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcK2MnKytZZGXvLexjpqpraGTobKggcFwb3JxlGd6eoXFcmRqaZWaeqKCkptkn2%2BVbIakgZadmXBvXp3Brrg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
