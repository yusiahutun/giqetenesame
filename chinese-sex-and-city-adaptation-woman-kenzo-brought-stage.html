In a time where people in Hong Kong were just beginning to be very wealthy. And people were getting to know how to enjoy life,” explains Ko.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The script features four women living in the city, trying to find success in their careers and personal lives. It has been called the “Chinese version of Sex and the City”, despite the original novella appearing long before the popular HBO series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/14/78571607-2e0c-4382-96d5-e4354e4248d1_1fbd696e.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Scriptwriter Chris Shum has over time adapted the story to be far more dynamic for a modern and diverse audience, says Ko.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Yes, it’s about career paths and finding love, which people can relate to, but it’s also about how you view yourself and where you want to see yourself.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong-born author on her autobiographical debut novel</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ko was inspired by the novel and aimed rather ambitiously to turn it into a musical. In the first two years, the first tracks were produced. Despite finishing a script, which was well received at a reading event (with the Actors' Family) in 2013, casting and scheduling issues left The Woman in Kenzo on the back burner for several years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ko says the production has been “racked with ups and downs” – a proposed Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts version was never staged in 2019 – and he is excited to finally see it debut.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The music of The Woman in Kenzo harnesses disco and funk with modern twists to create something that audiences of any age can resonate with, even if they are not familiar with 1970s music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/14/0f681418-6156-41c3-b35f-fbf1a33589c3_7a3b138d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ko has worked on an array of musical endeavours. His first published song was a track in actor-singer Patrick Tam Yiu-man’s debut album in 1989, followed by a chart-topper for Canto-pop singer Andy Lau Tak-wah in 1992.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A prolific film composer, he has won Golden Horse Awards for a track he co-wrote with Peter Kam Pui-tat for the movie Perhaps Love (2005) and among his Cantonese musicals, The Good Person of Szechwan (2003) and The Legend of the White Snake (2006) won best original score at the Hong Kong Drama Awards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He enjoys juggling several productions at the same time. While Woman in Kenzo was on hold, he worked on several other projects including compositions for Chinese films Monster Hunt 2 (2018) and Love is a Broadway Hit (2017).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, he has four other works in production, and shows lined up until 2023.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ko hopes The Woman in Kenzo will be enjoyed by a wider audience, including non-Cantonese speakers, part of the reason why this production will have full English surtitles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The script is already very bilingual, so I thought well it’s probably better to have a full translation of the whole script and the songs,” says Ko.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The Woman in Kenzo</strong>, Chung Ying Theatre Company, October 22, 23, 29, 30 at 8pm; Oct 23, 24, 30 and 31 at 3pm; Kwai Tsing Theatre.
