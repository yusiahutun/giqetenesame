To explain this, he started his wrestling in his sophomore years, where he had a 122 to 10 combined win-loss record and was a twice champion in heavyweight South Carolina high school (1993-1994).</p><p>He studied at Lassen Community College in Susanville, California, where he won the 100m track and field championship of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA).

He has moved his Junior and Senior College Bursaries to the University of Minnesota for his further studies. During his time at the university, he registered a total win-loss score of 36–6. Benjamin began to serve as an assistant wrestling coach at the same university soon after graduation. In the meantime, he was able to practice with potential team partner Brock Lesnar from the Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). He then decided instead of qualifying for the 2000 Summer Olympics to follow his career as a professional wrestler.</p><p>Benjamin made his professional debut with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as it was put in its Ohio Valley Wrestling creation territory (OVW). He had met and formed Brock Leshnar a tag team with him, together known as the “Minnesota Stretching Crew,” after which they had won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions.</p><p>The Minnesota Stretching Crew ruled in February and July and on October 29, it won the title for the third time. In November, however, Leshnar had to go to the main roster and so Benjamin formed a Tag Team called “The Dogg Pound” by Redd Dogg Begnaud.</p><p>They won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship together on 17 July 2002 and proceeded with numerous house shows for the main WWE roster. Therefore he made his WWE TV debut as a heroic character on Sunday Night Heat.</p><p>Benjamin joined WWE’s SmackDown on December 26, 2002!

Unfortunately, they suffered a defeat at Judgment Day in a ladder match against Eddie Guerrero and his new partner Tajiri.</p><p>Angle’s rose fight with Benjamin and Hass ended on June 12, 2003, in the SmackDown episode of the ‘gang angle’!

She also stood up for Benjamin, which led him for the second time in his career to play the part of the heel.’</p><p>He began feuding for the year against Ric Flair, then Intercontinental Champion, and wrestled with him on 20 February. During the match, “Momma” fakes a heart problem which gives Benjamin enough time to cheat and win the Intercontinental Champion title.</p><p>As the time passed, “mommy” began taking part in Benjamin’s ring games. Benjamin thus explains her absence because of her cardiac operation, but the reality spreads and says it is because someone in the WWE sexually assaulted her. Going forward, Benjamin began his rivalry with Rob Van Dam after WrestleMania 22’s Money on the Bank ladder game. Therefore, as he joined the ring he modified his look with colors, jewelry, and sometimes colored tops.</p><p>In addition, Hass defeated Benjamin during Raw’s episode, leading to the Backlash “Winner Takes All” match.
