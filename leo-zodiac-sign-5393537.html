Annually, approximately between July 23 and August 22, the sun moves through the fifth sign of the zodiac, Leo, symbolized by the regal Lion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the heart of summer, our minds drift away from the must-dos and the organizational details of life and toward spontaneous hangs with friends, whimsical, impromptu road trips, vacations (or staycations), summer romance, and posting poolside thirst traps â€” all the playful, lighthearted pleasures of the sunniest season. This passionate, fun-loving energy is informed by Leo, a fire sign associated with light, love, confidence, buoyant and positive vibes and the tendency to take bold action or transform everyday life into a vibrant, colorful, drama-packed stage. These traits are owed to Leo's ruling luminous celestial body, the sun, which oversees image, identity, personal style, vitality, and self-esteem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few charismatic, optimistic, and natural born leaders who were born under Leo: Meghan Markle, Gina Rodriguez, Jennifer Lopez, Monica Lewinsky, Jennifer Lawrence, Demi Lovato, and Cara Delevingne are all astrologically influenced to claim the spotlight, using their empowered voices to express what's in their big hearts while inspiring and cheering on others to do the same.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, everything you need to know about the loyal, generous, charismatic sign.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-leo-personality-traits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Leo Personality Traits</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Those born between July 23 and August 22 can generally assume that their sun sign is Leo. (It's not definitive, because the sun moves between signs on different days annually.) Also note that while we tend to refer to ourselves as our sun sign, it's just one detail of a natal chart, which is basically a unique snapshot of the sky when you were born. But it's a detail that helps color your core sense of self, identity, personal style, self-esteem and confidence.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The star of the zodiac</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typical sun in Leo traits include being confident, comfortable being the center of attention, drama-adoring, ambitious, loyal, fiercely protective of their nearest and dearest, generous, luxury-loving, sunny, and big-hearted. Their characteristics reflect themes covered by the Fifth House of Romance and Self-Expression, which Leo rules. The Fifth House oversees leisurely fun, creativity, children, pleasure, and the most spirited, effervescent expressions of love and sex, like flirting and dating.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The natural-born leader</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since the vitality-bringing, confidence-enhancing sun has such a clear impact on Leo's personality, the fire sign tends to go toward opportunities to run whatever literal or figurative show they're most drawn to. They'll naturally slide into an executive position, guiding a team effortlessly from the front of any room, decide they can make a real difference by running for local government, or aspire to see their name in lights as the headliner of a hit production. But just as readily as they might seek to lead and soak up attention and applause, they'll shine their blinding, perpetually warm inner light on those around them, throwing themselves into planning an OTT celebration for a loved one with all the most gasp-worthy decor and gourmet bites, devote time and money to a favorite charity, or plan (and shell out for) a memorable, lavish anniversary getaway with their true love. After all, when it comes to following their hearts and setting themselves up for the ultimate fun, pleasurable, fancypants experience, dynamic, life-loving Leos will spare no expense.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The fixed fire sign</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Every sign is assigned a quality (cardinal, mutable, or fixed), which explains the sign's basic energy. There's a cardinal, mutable, and fixed sign within every element (fire, earth, air, water). Leo is the fixed one of the fire group, which gives them a hard-headed, resolute, and rock-steady perspective on anything they're attached to. They often get set in their ways and might need extra motivation to change course midstream.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Leo's best personality traits:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Full of life, commanding the spotlight in a way that's sure to entertain, engage, and inspire others, independent-minded, and mesmerizingly fun to be around, you can rely on Leos in your circle to help you see the bright side of any situation and feel fired up and ready to take on the world. They are the positive self- and body image crusaders of the zodiac. They're the charming boss with a big heart who understands a healthy work-life balance is the ultimate key to productivity. They're the friend who will chase relentlessly after a starry-eyed dream they've had since junior high and then actually make it a reality.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Leo's worst personality traits:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Leo's innate self-confidence and bold, take-charge ways can absolutely manifest in a problematic way from time to time. They can be self-focused to a fault, vain, narcissistic, domineering, and greedy. When they lack self-awareness, they can be frustratingly narrow-minded, knee-jerking to unfounded and roaring egomania. They can also descend into a gloomy mood, likely as a result of feeling like they're not getting the attention, credit, or respect they deserve. The fix: perfecting their self-love and self-soothing routine.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-leos-are-like-in-love--bed></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Leos Are Like in Love & Bed</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Leo's romance style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your date has major, pie-in-the-sky dreams about being a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author or TikTok star, has an Insta grid filled with a notable number of selfies, and a voracious appetite for fancy weekend getaways or, at the very least, the bites from the best restaurants in town, you're likely seeing someone born under the influence of sunny, dynamic, self-assured, charismatic Leo energy. The fire sign is passionate and easily, naturally shines wherever they go, and potential partners or significant others of a Leo will revel in their warm, joyful light. As much as they tend to seek resounding applause from the world, they'll be most content if they feel fawned over by someone they're equally wild about. Embracing life's simplest and grandest moments with a lover they share magical, sparkly chemistry with is the stuff Leo fantasies are made of. Anyone hoping to move forward in a relationship with a Leo would do well to lean into optimism, a love of living, and an appreciation for luxury, as even the most modest lion would adore the regal treatment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, Leo's perfect date is one you might imagine playing out in your favorite rom-com. That might include procuring the most gasp-worthy, gorgeous roses, dinner reservations at the trendiest spot in town, or taking a spontaneous trip to a beach side town that's undeniably cinematic. In less socially-distanced times, tickets to a movie premiere or front row seats at an exciting concert â€” where they can flaunt their contagious dance moves â€” would also appeal, and because they love being the star of the show in a group, they'll rarely pass on a party invitation.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Leo's sexual style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Leo's showy, romantic vibe is bound to be on full display in the bedroom. Heartfelt compliments are welcome, but physical expression of affection is something the lion can't resist, daydreams about, and craves in any intimate relationship. While their high sex drive makes it possible for them to hook up sans strings, they'll be most content if off-the-charts, chemistry-packed physical, intellectual, emotional attraction <i>and</i> love is a part of the equation. After all, just as with other departments in life, they feel they deserve the whole kit and caboodle in their sexual relationships.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Playful, fun-loving activities that allow their inner, cheerful kid to shine â€” be that an impromptu dance party or day spent sunbathing poolside â€” can rev their already intense appetite for sex even higher. Given their love of luxury, a stay at a celeb-loved resort, enjoying a couples' massage at a five-star spa, or splurging on designer lingerie or high thread-count sheets could set the tone, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once they're fully engaged in a sexy throw down, the lion tends to love exhibitionism (think classy-sneaky PDA, mirror-centric poses, or making a cam girl fantasy a reality) and being complimented for their efforts and how they look in the act. They're also vocal, making animalistic, guttural moans and noises, and down to keep the moment playful and interesting by experimenting with various intensities, positions, or toys.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-leo-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Leo Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wondering how Leo matches up with your sign as a friend, a lover, a colleague, or in terms of any other one-on-one relationship? Here, their most simpatico partners as well as clash-prone pairings:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Most compatible with Leo:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Signs that share the same element tend to be the most in sync (e.g. two earth signs, like Libra and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gemini</a>). But in the case of one fire sign with the other, it can really go to one extreme or the other. Either you'll feel like your companionship breeds mutual passion, creativity, playfulness, and excitement, and/or you could be prone to hotheaded blow-ups, drama, and incessant conflict. Fire is also traditionally compatible with air, as the two elements share certain attributes, like being free-spirited, independent, speedy, and social.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, a Leo often sparks with a fellow joie de vivre-filled Sagittarius, active <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aries</a>, or romantic Libra.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Least compatible with Leo:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with most of the zodiac signs, opposites can attract â€” and Leo and Aquarius often connect on their shared love of socializing. They're both people people. But because both are fixed and tend to dig their heels in, they can find it hard to adapt and compromise in order to find common ground. Plus, Leos have such an intense sense of self while Aquarians are geared to thinking about the universal, communal scheme of things.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Leo is also square (the most challenging angle that can exist between two signs) down-to-earth <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taurus</a> and power-seeking Scorpio. Unless they have other positive aspects in their natal charts, Leo can respect these two other fixed signs for their ability to take a position and then see it through, but emotionally, they're too unwavering to enjoy a harmonious connection.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-if-you-have-leo-elsewhere-in-your-chart></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What If You Have Leo Elsewhere in Your Chart?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As mentioned previously, the sun sign is one of many aspects of a natal chart. When you were born, the moon and all the planets in our solar system were in one of the 12 signs and a particular position â€” all of which help to inform your personality and areas of your life. Here's what it means if Leo shows up in any of the main areas of your chart:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Leo Moon</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The moon, which spends about two to three days in each sign, influences your emotions and intuition. If it was in Leo at the time of your birth, you tend to own your feelings and be rather direct and confident in expressing them. And when it comes to matters of the heart, you'll also tend to err toward making unabashedly bold statements and gestures.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Leo Mercury</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mercury, which spends about two to three weeks in a sign, shapes your communication style. If it was in Leo when you were born, you're likely a natural born show person. Commanding the spotlight and leading the charge come naturally to you, especially when called upon to express yourself verbally.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Leo Venus</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Venus, which remains in a sign for about three to five weeks, influences how you behave in relationships and how you attract others. If you were born with the planet of love and beauty in Leo, you likely adore showy displays of affection and Hollywood-worthy date nights. Even if you're not literally walking a red carpet, you'll want your partner to help you feel as though you are by showering you in passionate actions and heartfelt words. As for your date night style, a sexy blowout (Leos are all about their manes) is your fast track to feeling like a million bucks, as would be wearing jewel tones or eye-catching statement bling (gold is Leo's go-to metal).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Leo Mars</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mars, which remains in a sign for six or seven weeks, affects your energy, strength, sexual style, and how you experience courage. If you were born while the fiery, dynamic, fighter planet was in fixed, fiery Leo, you're a go-getter who will stop at just about nothing to make your dreams â€” professional or personal â€” come true. While tackling a project with others, you'll naturally gravitate to a leadership position or any performative, respect-commanding role. Your colleagues will appreciate that you bring an aggressive but optimistic perspective to the table.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Leo Ascendant (or Rising)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your ascendant or rising sign influences how you present yourself to the world. As a Leo ascendant, you come off as positive, cheerful, charismatic, full of joie de vivre, and action-oriented. You're basically sunshine personified.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y56mZrKfmbair4ysoKCmXWqAen%2BUbG4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
