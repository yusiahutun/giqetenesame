I've been married twice. He's never been married," McEntire explains. "So if he wants to, that's totally up to him."</p><p>McEntire first got married in 1976 to rodeo steer-wrestling champion Charlie Battles. They split 11 years later, and in 1989, the country star married producer and artist manager Narvel Blackstock. The pair were married for 26 year and share a son named Shelby Blackstock. They divorced in 2015.</p><p>Meanwhile, Linn — who is best known for his roles in CSI: Miami and Better Call Saul&nbsp;— has never tied the knot, at 66 years old.</p><p>But even though it's a little unusual for someone to get to their 60s without ever marrying, McEntire says that plot point from Linn's biography ultimately wouldn't dissuade her from walking down the aisle.</p><p>"Was it a head-scratcher? Well, yeah, kind of," the singer says when asked if Linn's perennially single status threw up any red flags for her. "We talked it out. Yeah."</p><p>McEntire and Linn might not be tying the knot — at least, not yet — but their relationship certainly has plenty of elements of domestic bliss. Most recently, McEntire <a href=#>revealed that Linn loves her salted chocolate chip cookies </a>so much that he's been begging her to stop giving them away to other people.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Reba McEntire's Stunning $5 Million Nashville Mansion</h2><p>Reba McEntire lived the good life in a spectacular waterfront mansion outside of Nashville, which she sold in 2017.
