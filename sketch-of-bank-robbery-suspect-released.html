He was wearing a tri-colored coat consisting of a dark color, light blue&nbsp;and white, blue jeans, white tennis shoes, possibly a camo hat, sunglasses and&nbsp;a white&nbsp;material worn over his&nbsp;face. He was armed with what appeared to be a handgun and was carrying a black duffel bag.</p><p>The suspect was last seen on foot going west from the bank.</p><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Illinois State Police CSI, and Warren County Sheriff’s Deputies were on the scene investigating the matter throughout the afternoon and evening. The Monmouth Police Department also provided assistance.</p><p>What happened at the bank quickly became&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the talk of the town.&nbsp;</p><p>Works At Antique Shop June Miller said, “It’s a real shock. Usually, you think about things like this happening in bigger cities, but I was shocked.”</p><p>The center of conversation in Roseville is Citizen’s National Bank in the heart of the community.</p><p>L Salon and Spa owner Lissa Mings&nbsp;“To be held at gunpoint is not something you expect in a small town like this.”</p><p>Lissa Mings owns the salon across the street from the bank and says she’s not only concerned that this could happen in her town but also so close to home.</p><p>“My mom works over at the bank, my best friend does,” Mings said.&nbsp; “A lot of our friends work over there, and this is a small community that we enjoy being a safe place and it was very shocking and upsetting.”</p><p>No one was injured during the incident, but it’s left her mom and friend shaken.</p><p>Mings said, “Anyone held at gunpoint, it’s not something that you’re expecting, so they’re dealing with it and doing the best that they can.”</p><p>Since then, this usually quiet town has been filled with a bit more activity.</p><p>Warren County Sheriff Martin Edwards said, “We conducted an area search. Ultimately did not locate the subject. We’re still continuing to canvas and go back and re-talk to people to make sure that we haven’t missed anybody.”</p><p>Sheriff Martin Edwards says one distinctive feature of the suspect was his tri-colored coat– dark in color with light blue and white accents.&nbsp;<br>As that investigation continues, the county is receiving help from the FBI.</p><p>Edwards said,&nbsp;“An agency well versed in these types of crimes. This is not something that happens typically in our area.”</p><p>In Roseville, the hope is it will not happen again.</p><p>Mings said,&nbsp;“They just need to stay out of our small town.”</p><p>Sheriff Edwards says the employees of the bank were trained how to handle a robbery, which they used yesterday.</p><p>Anyone with information in this matter is encouraged to contact the Warren County Sheriff’s Office at 309-734-8505&nbsp;or Crime Stoppers at 309-734-9363.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46sop6sk516sLKMm5ino12nvKOuxKuwZqulqL2mr9NmqZ6klZbAprCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
