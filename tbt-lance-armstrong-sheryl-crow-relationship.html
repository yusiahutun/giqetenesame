"The idea of the song is that no matter how chaotic it is, wildflowers will still spring up in the middle of nowhere."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of Armstrong's kids, she&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly</a>, "I love them as much as if they were my own."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Crow drew inspiration from Armstrong's career, too.

"We both have a deep love and respect for each other, and we ask that everyone respect our privacy during this very difficult time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adding to the tabloid drama of the split, Crow announced that she'd been diagnosed with breast cancer weeks later. Many were quick to speculate that Armstrong had left her amid the diagnosis, a theory Crow herself debunked in an&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with&nbsp;Good Morning America</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We really loved each other a lot and still love each other a lot," she insisted.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though she wouldn't name a reason for the breakup, she told former host&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Diane Sawyer</a>&nbsp;that she couldn't "be angry at Lance for being who he is."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You know, he's a great person, and it's his life, too … It's about what he wants, and it's about what I want. And where the two don't meet, there's definitely a, you know, a fissure," she said of the breakup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "It is like a death. And in many ways it's like having part of your life amputated, but you still have that phantom itch, you know, where you wake up and I'll see something and think, 'Oh, I've got to make sure Lance is hip to this band. I've got to put it on his iPod.' And then I remember, 'Oh, wait, you know, that's not my life.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2008&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with&nbsp;Glamour</a>, Crow (who'd been engaged three times) responded to the journalist's suggestion that she "secretly" didn't want to be married.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are definitely reasons as to why I'm not married," she said.

"Yet, we're up against her biological clock — that pressure is what cracked it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Armstrong admitted to taking performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career in 2013, Crow was asked for her opinion (again and again). Though she often gave canned responses, like she did during an&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with&nbsp;USA Today</a>&nbsp;when she said, "The truth will set you free," Crow ultimately let her feelings be known in late 2013.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It probably sounds really insulting, but this is one of those I-don't-give-a-fuck moments: I don't think about him," she&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told&nbsp;Rolling Stone</a>. "It's a nuisance when I'm asked about him, because they weren't the happiest of days.
