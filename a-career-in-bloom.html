Instead, she discovered a passion for creativity through art and photography classes. One summer, she took a part-time job at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">A Goode Florist</a>, answering phones and helping customers.&nbsp;“I was fortunate enough to learn floral design hands-on from all of the amazingly talented and experienced ladies around me,” Siliato recalls. The fun summer job was slowly blooming into a lifelong career.</p><p>She eventually took on a managerial position, basically running the shop for the owners when they were out of town. Eight years after Siliato&nbsp;started working at A Good Florist, the owners—who had opened it in 1979—decided to put the store up for sale. “I jumped at the chance to own the place myself,” she says. “My parents were business owners [of Ron’s Auto Repair] for 30 years in Stuart,&nbsp;and now I’m proud to be a local business owner here as well.”<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/05/img_20190611_161101_388.jpg alt width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Today, A Goode Florist is a family-run establishment. Siliato’s mom, Kathy, has been helping out ever since she took ownership. Her niece also works at the shop while attending college, and her husband and in-laws help out during busy holidays. “As for the rest of my staff, they are like family as well,” Siliato says. “When you come into my shop, you really feel like we care about you—and I think that makes a difference. I have so many great memories working and owning this flower shop. I have gotten to be a part of some many wonderful things over the years.”</p><p>When she isn’t bundling bouquets, Siliato spends much of her time at her horse farm in Palm City. “I was born and raised in Martin County,” she says. “It’s where my husband and I grew up and are now raising our [11-year-old] daughter.”</p><p><strong><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/05/polish_20200303_162635714_1-200x300.jpg alt width=200 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>QUICK QS WITH KELLY</strong></p><p><strong>Favorite arrangement addition?</strong></p><p>I’m in love with fresh foliage—assorted fresh greenery is a must in my shop!
