Some studies have suggested that factory-pressed CDs and DVDs may last for up to 20 years or more under ideal conditions, while others have found that they may begin to degrade after just a few years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>4 Reasons You Should Still Keep an Optical Drive Around</a></span></p><p>For example, <a href=#>a study</a> conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with the Library of Congress, found that the lifespan of CDs and DVDs can range from as little as two years to more than 30 years. What makes the difference is the discs' quality and storage conditions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In contrast, CDs and DVDs burned at home may have a significantly shorter lifespan. This is because burning can often make lower-quality discs more susceptible to damage and degradation. That means you should store burned CDs and DVDs under ideal conditions and back them up regularly to ensure that the data they contain isn't lost.</p><p>For backup purposes, you may want to buy special archival-grade blank discs, which if handled correctly are rated for decades or even centuries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/51orateudfl-_sl160_-1.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>98913 Verbatim M-Disc BDXL 100GB</h5>$67 <span class=regular-price>$92</span> Save $25<p class=display-card-description>These archival grade disks will probably outlast you and your grandchildren</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$67 at Amazon</a><h2 id=factors-that-affect-the-durability-of-cds-and-dvds>Factors That Affect the Durability of CDs and DVDs</h2><p>Some of the most important factors that can affect the lifespan of CDs and DVDs include:</p><ul><li>Disc quality</li><li>Disc type</li><li>How you store the disc</li><li>How you handle the disc</li><li>The type of data stored on the disc</li><li>The quality of the CD or <a href=#>DVD player</a>&nbsp;you put the disc in</li></ul><p>Maximizing as many of these factors as possible will increase the odds that your discs will last as long as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-extend-the-lifespan-of-cds-and-dvds>How to Extend the Lifespan of CDs and DVDs</h2><p>You can take several steps to extend the lifespan of CDs and DVDs and ensure that the data they contain remains accessible for as long as possible. Some tips for increasing the longevity of CDs and DVDs include:</p><ul><li>Store CDs and DVDs in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and other sources of heat and moisture. Exposure to high temperatures and humidity can cause CDs and DVDs to warp or be damaged, reducing their lifespan.</li><li>Handle CDs and DVDs carefully to avoid scratches and other physical damage. Avoid touching the disc's surface, and use a soft cloth to clean any dirt or fingerprints on the disc.</li><li>Avoid leaving CDs and DVDs in a car or other hot, humid environments. The heat and moisture in a car can also cause CDs and DVDs to warp or become damaged.</li><li>Use high-quality CD and DVD players that are less likely to cause scratches or other physical damage.</li><li>Back up the data on CDs and DVDs regularly. This will ensure you have a copy of the data in case the disc becomes damaged or lost.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With all of that in mind, you should also consider using alternative storage methods for essential data. CDs and DVDs may not be <a href=#>the most reliable data storage method in the long term</a>. Consider using other storage methods, such as <a href=#>hard drives</a> or <a href=#>cloud-based services</a>, for valuable data you want to protect. Using multiple forms of media is always better than putting all your eggs in one basket.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhvbmxhaIRwtM6wZKWnnpx6pbuMnJusZZGjsW6w1Z2qZqSRqMFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
