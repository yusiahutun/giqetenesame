the decade which sparked a mighty feud between her and Esther McVey.</p><p>During a live link to ITV’s Lorraine from Good Morning Britain in 2019, the pair's famous row was brought to life once again when GMB host Susanna Reid asked Lorraine if she remembered Esther from her GMTV days where they shared a dressing room.</p><p>It led to Lorraine replying: "Yeah, yes I do," before moving very swiftly on to what was coming up on her show.</p><p>In typical Piers Morgan fashion he asked the question on most people's mind, "do you get on now?".</p><p>To which Lorraine replied: "I don’t remember, love, I don’t remember at all, it was an awful long time ago."</p><p>So, what happened between Lorraine and Esther for tension to be there nearly 30 years later?</p><img

exactly what went down.</p><p>Back in 2019, following Lorraine's comments on Esther to Piers, Esther spoke out later that exact same day.</p><p>Speaking to Piers, McVey played down rumours that had sparked on social media that there was a feud between the pair.</p><p>She said: "I'm baffled, because I had my own show since 1992, and I don't actually think she joined until five years later.</p><p>"And as far as sharing dressing rooms go, it wasn't really like that, it's not palatial like it is now... it was just a little room that everybody sort of shared that we got ready in.</p><p>"I'll be genuinely honest, I don't remember her being... it was such a long time ago.

Not at all.</p><p>"What I find really shocking about it is... no apology. The arrogance of it. The arrogance is breathtaking."</p><p>Lorraine continued: "Do you not think when the spin doctor becomes the story, it's time to go?

Do you have a Hugh Jackman statue in your garden?"</p><p>She responded: "I’ve not got a Hugh Jackman statue in my garden but that doesn’t mean that I wouldn’t.</p><p>"I’m actually inspired by you. I mean, who doesn’t love Hugh Jackman? It’s the law, you have to!"</p><p>Richard asked: “Which part of Hugh Jackman do you want as a statue?”</p><p>Giggling, Lorraine said: "All of it, just all of it. He’s gorgeous! Almost as gorgeous as you Richard E. Grant.</p><p>"It’s fantastic to talk to you."</p><p>As the interview came to and end, GMB's DR Hilary couldn't help but poke fun at his co-workers "disgraceful flirting".</p><p>Lorraine told the doctor: “Isn’t he great?
