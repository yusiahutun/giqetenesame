The picture, taken at Disneyland last week, shows the singer holding the cob upright, like an ice cream, as he prepares to take a big bite from the top – and fans quickly started to joke about his <strong>unusual eating technique</strong>.Responding to the funny image, which has been meme-ified a number of times, the Canadian star wrote: "<strong>This is vegetable harassment!!! </strong>What I do with my Cobb is nobody's business. #mesocorny #paparazzi #shuckme."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d186fc6a208b-buble-z.jpg><p id=evZbmW4j5dra data-wc=14><strong>Michael had a hilarious response to memes of his corn on the cob photo</strong></p><p id=eYFGhgqrmHMc data-wc=84>It's no wonder Michael is in such high spirits. He and his wife <a class=hm-link href=#>Luisana Lopilato</a> have been enjoying their precious first few months with second son <strong>Elias</strong>, who was <a class=hm-link href=#>born on 22 January</a>. The couple are also parents to two-year-old <strong>Noah</strong>, and are clearly totally besotted with their "little men".Just last month Argentine model Luisana <a class=hm-link href=#>shared a photograph</a> of herself cuddled up with her little boys. "How can I explain this photo? I can't!" the 28-year-old captioned the image. "I melt and I melt every day more because of these little men."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a48137ae72ed-buble2-z.jpg><p id=eEv3wf0FAnRj data-wc=10><strong>Michael and Luisana are proud parents to two little boys</strong></p><p id=e8wKBjRBrow- data-wc=45>Michael, meanwhile, has previously said that becoming a father again is "<a class=hm-link href=#>as good as it gets</a>". The proud dad announced the birth of his second child by sharing a family photo from the hospital, writing: "And then there were 4. Introducing Noah's little brother Elias Buble #family #blessed #brothers."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8f17895e93b8-buble-3-a.jpg><p id=en4e1PWQ5WIc data-wc=10><strong>The singer recently shared an adorable photo of two-year-old Noah</strong></p><p id=e0mWyyuacu6n data-wc=60>Michael, 40, also described firstborn Noah as his "everything" in another touching post from a recent holiday to Hawaii. Alongside an image showing Michael with the toddler sat on his shoulders, the singer wrote: "I hate posting just anything, so instead, I'm posting my everything. We're on the best vacation ever. Lots of sunshine with my sunshine. #family #vacation #meandmyshadow."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQb2dtaWhofXqCmGikopuYlrKtecGumaWdXaeytLzOp5usZZOkv695zqdkraCVYrCwro4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
