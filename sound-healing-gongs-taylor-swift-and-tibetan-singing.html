Such a crucial determination, he says, “is just not questioned, not even really deviated from”.</p>His belief? Tuning A to a slightly lower 432 hertz, and adjusting scales to calculate this change, sounds and feels better than the “brighter” 440 hertz. Maejor compares this epiphany on his podcast, Maejor Frequency, to “when you let out a huge sigh and your body floods with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">serotonin</span></a>, and you realise you’ve arrived at the place that you belonged all along”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hertz” is a measurement of repeating patterns that signifies the cycles per second at which air molecules vibrate as sound travels. A tuning fork that resonates in the key of A, when struck, will cause a wave of 440 hertz to vibrate air particles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/18/95c1bfdc-5ba3-453d-b492-96364c7c0a96_e18049fa.jpg>For the Los Angeles-based Maejor and millions of others meditating to or creating “frequency music” on YouTube, Spotify and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">TikTok</span></a>, the frequency of 432 hertz is more aligned with nature’s patterns. When that root frequency activates the eardrums, it fills you with positive vibrations.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prolonged listening to these 432-hertz tones, they claim, reduces stress, “detoxifies” cells and organs, eliminates fear and wipes out negativity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These beliefs are part of a long fascination with “pitch correcting” the Western music scale.

TikTok’s “frequency music” hashtag offers countless portals into a range of aural philosophies.</p>The beliefs have absorbed inspiration from chants sung during ancient Gregorian masses; the chakra meditation points used in Hindu-based <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">mindfulness practices</span></a>; the Buddhist beliefs on drone-driven serenity; the US west coast New-Age music community; and ideas born from sound therapy practitioners working to alleviate trauma.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Meditation: a Silicon Valley executive’s secret to success</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“432 is one with the world around it. We are all one. Everything is one,” Maejor testifies on his podcast.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The argument for a switch from 440 to 432 hertz rests as much on feeling as it does on science. Most people wouldn’t be able to discern such microtonal shifts up or down eight hertz.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ruth Rosenberg, a music professor at University of Illinois Chicago, started studying 432-hertz music in the mid-2010s. After researching the alleged negativity of 440 hertz, Rosenberg was struck by “this idea that pop music could be harmful to you”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/18/015d3837-74e3-458b-8e4a-26d2c59a65d7_fc2457ad.jpg>Since Rosenberg first came across the ideas, artists including Prince, Aphex Twin and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Kanye West</span></a> have chimed in on the positive and negative effects of specific frequencies.YouTube channels that pitch-shift today’s biggest pop songs from 440 to 432 hertz claim their versions to be more “in tune” with the universe’s frequency. Soon after <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Taylor Swift</span></a> released her 10-minute version of All Too Well, a 432-hertz version arrived.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If you do an A and B comparison between a 432 and a 440, most people don’t hear an audible difference. But people will tell you they profoundly do, and what I took from the listeners is that they experience something really different,” says Rosenberg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/18/681eb40c-2cd4-4927-9773-dcefb945a6b1_3a5c980d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One voice Maejor was drawn to was Ana Netanel, who describes herself on her Shakti Sound Bath website as an “international wellness practitioner and instructor specialising in the restorative and healing power of sound frequency and vibration”.</p>Netanel has preached the power of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">kundalini yoga</span></a> and sound baths for about two decades. She and her baths, which include singing bowls tuned to 432 hertz, have appeared on television shows Grey’s Anatomy and The Hills.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Netanel says: “Healing sounds help to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for rest and digest, and they really help to relax.” Like Maejor, Netanel’s goal “is to bring sound healing to the mainstream”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The warning signs of stress, how it can make you ill and what to do</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If they succeed, they are likely to face resistance from the medical and science communities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So far as I can tell there is very little solid scientific evidence supporting any of these interesting new ideas,” says Dr Robert Bilder, director of the Tennenbaum Centre for the Biology of Creativity at the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behaviour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of his current students, he says, is getting ready to begin “a randomised controlled trial to see if Tibetan singing bowls have more benefits for psychological well-being relative to a simple relaxation meditation session. But so far there are few rigorous studies of these effects.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/18/d853e34c-2a20-424f-84cd-fa32f042ca7c_d0880283.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Netanel and her sound-healing students regularly converge on land overlooking the Pacific Ocean to relax to the sound of singing bowls tuned to 432 hertz and gongs that blitz the eardrums with volumes of various frequencies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On a recent Sunday afternoon, about 50 of us are inside a wide circle of gongs, bowls, shakers and rain sticks to lie down and be bathed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We recline into savasana, or corpse pose. Sitting before a trio of gongs, Netanel starts gently tapping a padded mallet on the largest of them; her students do the same on theirs.

A harpist gently strums out vague dots of melody.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At some point, the players return to gongs, activating them with a power that at first feels like angels revving their wings, then God piloting a jet-fuelled chariot.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fifteen minutes later, a resonant hum is scoring my drive home.
