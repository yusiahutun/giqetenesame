She remained a loyal member of the religion for some 35 years before defecting, in what she’s previously described as a “rebirth.” And the former <a href=#>King of Queens</a> actress has been an outspoken critic of the Church of Scientology ever since.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Katie Holmes May Not Be a Scientologist Today, but She Still Has Ties to the Church</a></p><p>During a recent <a href=#>“Ask Me Anything”</a> interview on Reddit to promote the second season of her wildly-successful A&E show, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, Leah, 47, was asked if she thought <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> was a “good person” and she didn’t hold anything back in her response. “He’s very similar to [Church of Scientology Leader] David Miscavige, they could be twins,” she said.

Instead, she seeks publicity by maliciously spreading lies about the Church using the same handful of bitter zealots who were kicked out years ago for chronic dishonesty and corruption and whose false claims the Church refuted years ago, including through judicial decisions.”</p><p>This post was written by Candice Mehta-Culjak.
