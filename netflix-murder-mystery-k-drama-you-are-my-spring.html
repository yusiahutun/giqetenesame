Having been forced to flee the family home as a child thanks to a violent, alcoholic father, Kang Da-jeong (Seo Hyun-jin) is now, many years later, finding her feet in Seoul and planning a new start. But it is far from her first.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At an awkward social gathering with friends, her character is dissected by preternaturally perceptive psychiatrist Ju Young-do (Kim Dong-wook), whom she has just met – which doubles the mortification she feels when this almost total stranger discerns that she dreads emotional commitment and the idea of settling down.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also analyses her, correctly, as a walking catastrophe when dating because (carrying that childhood hangover) she subconsciously repeats a pattern by which she attracts men who are destructive or otherwise unhinged.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Da-jeong lashes out, verbally and physically, and so, having made such a lasting impact on each other, these two are bound to live happily ever after. And that, with such a sappy, translated title as You Are My Spring (Netflix, series one now streaming), might be all you’d expect from a cuddly caper like this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/08/20/5a882a4c-9a17-48b0-a0cc-0d3f8c5123cf_3ea3002f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not so fast. Because before any of that happens, the unlikely pair find themselves embroiled in a murder case that the Seoul police have been unable to solve.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Luckily for them, Young-do is a consultant to the police; and luckily for him he is able to keep his cool when suddenly burdened further by a second murder, on his door­step; the reappearance of a petulant, supposedly suicidal, self-obsessed model (his ex-wife); and the emergence of a well-dressed stalker with a smooth line in patter (Da-jeong’s other admirer, who may be a killer).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Which leaves us with a love triangle, or perhaps a square, and plenty of theories and suspicions. If perplexing storylines in a romance-murder-mystery are your thing, then your spring has sprung.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Simon Reeve takes us on an empathetic journey</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Simon Reeve is a sensitive soul. Having, by his own admission, gone off the rails somewhat in his youth, then realised what a winning hand fate subsequently dealt him, he can’t help but regularly reveal his emotional side in his travel series Incredible Journeys with Simon Reeve – which makes him a supremely empathetic middleman between us and everything he’s experienced in almost two decades of documentary making.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/08/20/b1aa0ead-35a9-4dfc-8e88-c79608329f16_379765f3.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And not all those experiences in this series, a four-part greatest-hits compilation of chunks from his previous shows, are good ones. For a presenter who genuinely feels that “people are the reason to travel” he can find himself understandably disillusioned with the harassment tactics of the Russian secret police – but then unexpectedly charmed by the mini-Gaddafi minder in Libya sent to spy on him and his crew.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Incredible Journeys (available on BBC Earth, and in Hong Kong via Cable TV channel 721 and Now TV channel 220) shows Reeve to be a sort of Palin’s apprentice, sharing the master’s wonder at sights of astounding beauty and feeling the same sort of impotent rage and regret at the ghastly poverty that, for example, puts young children to work at a Bangladeshi glass-recycling furnace, and the conflict that deposits an overcrowded boat of Syrian refugees at his feet in Greece.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Reeve acknowledges that but for luck and an accident of geography he could have been any of the unfortunates he encounters; and being a genuine sort of bloke he has little interest in the ostentatious wealth of the world or any excess-all-areas love of bling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/08/20/3cf4a42e-457d-418d-9147-d79b49aea771_cec9b3e1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alternatively, he seems as though he’d enjoy the lives of such cartoonish characters as Father Andreas, the gunslinging Greek priest, or Mr Big Beard, Mogadishu’s fake-passport king. But just for a little while.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOmqmtq12iwrS1wmiYq6yZmLmme5Jqa25wYGd8r7HTn6OisF2iwrOwxKtkprGjqbKzxYykZJ2qkaKubsXOrmSaqpViurp50qmpoqaX</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
