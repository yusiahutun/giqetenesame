Special potion ... Maybe I can collect life insurance," the woman -- who denies trying to kill her husband -- allegedly messaged someone she believed was Thorsten Kaye.</h2><p>A Massachusetts woman has been charged with the attempted murder of her husband, with investigators accusing her of poisoning him after a person she allegedly believed was a soap opera actor told her to "get rid" of him.</p><p>Roxanne Doucette, 64, has denied the charges against her -- after an investigation into her husband's hospitalization began in December. The woman's own daughter called the cops on her, after allegedly seeing messages on her phone while he was in the hospital.</p><p>Doucette believed the messages were coming from The Bold and the Beautiful actor Thorsten Kaye (above left), who she says scammed her out of $8,000, per authorities. After the woman enlisted her daughter's help to take screen shots of their correspondence to report the scam, her daughter also saw messages between the pair investigators now believe implicate Doucette in a far more nefarious plot.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3a3c16bf-cf3e-4d9f-a72f-0c91b818d28c data-container-ref=toofab:article:55bb54e4-ea6a-4f93-a7a9-6f35934113a6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/47/5by4/2024/01/10/47f95189fdc24ce9a8d6c8f277c25912_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Chicago Police Department, Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Pleads Guilty for Murder of Pregnant Teen Whose Baby Was Ripped from Her Womb</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to police docs, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WCVB</strong></a>, one message from the scammer read, "You have to get rid of your husband honey. I need you so much." Later that day, Doucette is said to have responded saying, "Making an amazing soup. Special potion. He will be hungry when he gets back. Just enough for him." Two hours after that, she then wrote, "Hubby got back not feeling well. Maybe I can collect life insurance."</p><p>When the person on the other end asked, "Honey, when will that be?", she allegedly responded, "Don't know." Shortly after that, she then called 911, telling them her husband was unresponsive.</p><p>After Paul Doucette, 73, regained consciousness at the hospital, his daughter asked him what he remembered. "Paul stated that Roxanne made him soup, but that it wasn't very good. He stated that it tasted bitter," said the docs.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1348a000-9274-459e-a679-22a0d7bfc420 data-container-ref=toofab:article:55bb54e4-ea6a-4f93-a7a9-6f35934113a6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d1/5by4/2024/01/09/d1c4bf19bcb94efda416ae89ceeef73b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / Hulu</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Gypsy Rose Blanchard Criticizes The Act, Reveals How Show Affected Her In Prison</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The woman's daughter then contacted police and went with her mother to the station to speak with investigators. While there, Roxanne refused to hand over her iPhone and iPad and allegedly kicked an officer in the crotch as they tried to take her into custody for interfering with a police investigation. She's since been charged with attempted murder, intimidation of a witness, resisting arrest and assault and battery of a police officer. She also allegedly violated a protective order filed by her husband.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>WBZ-TV</strong></a>, Doucette denied trying to kill her husband.</p><p>"I've never ever tried to poison him in any way whatsoever," Doucette said, claiming the soup was old. "I love him very, very much and I would never try to kill anyone."</p><p>"I just want him to come home. I just love him so much," she told the outlet, while also telling WCVB she believes her husband had a transient ischemic attack, or small stroke, paired with vertigo.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:1c9bcd5e-e6f1-4dee-a4a6-df478b199951 data-container-ref=toofab:article:55bb54e4-ea6a-4f93-a7a9-6f35934113a6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c0/5by4/2024/01/05/c0a7c907537a41f39a982cd9b0ff5f52_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">SAN ANTONIO POLICE DEPARTMENT; LEON VALLEY POLICE DEPARTMENT</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Pregnant Teen Fatally Shot Alongside Boyfriend: Cops Reveal Gruesome Details as Father & Son Arrested</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Of her catfish, she said the person told her that they loved her and "wanted me to leave my husband." She added, "I had no intentions of leaving my husband. I love my husband very much."</p><p>A limited toxicology test looking for opioids, cocaine and alcohol came back negative, with Police Chief James Sartell warning interested parties to "just kind of take a step back, take a deep breath" and to "think things through before you spread things, or before you know what's going on." He added, "Sometimes it's a little more complex than it seems."</p><p>Doucette's next court date is set for Thursday, January 11.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmamhfp7y5rc2nnGacn6qwpsDTnmSmraKZsrN506Gmq6ukmrtut8CynGark5a6cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
