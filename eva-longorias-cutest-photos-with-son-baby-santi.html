Whether they’re <a href=#>cooking in the kitchen</a> or <a href=#>basking in the sun</a> beside their pool, the <a href=#>Desperate Housewives</a> alum is always giving fans glimpses inside her life as a mom.</p><p>The actress <a href=#>welcomed baby Santi</a> on June 19, 2018, with her husband, <a href=#><strong>José Bastón</strong></a>. Eva and the Mexican businessman married two years earlier in 2016, and because José had already welcomed four kids during his first marriage with ex-wife <strong>Natalia Esperón</strong>, Eva became a pro at being a stepmom.</p><p>No matter how experienced Eva was with being a stepmom, though, <a href=#>becoming the mom of her own</a> little one was a completely new task. At the time Santiago came along, the Dora and the Lost City of Gold star stepped back from her Hollywood career to care for her then-newborn.</p><p>After spending nonstop time at home with her little one, Eva admitted “going back to work was hard,” she told <a href=#>Parents</a> magazine in July 2019. “Breast-feeding while working was hard, just for the timing of the pumping and the feedings and the sleeping and the not sleeping. … You just do it and get it done.” And while Eva said baby Santi is “healthy, funny, sweet and he sleeps,” she sometimes struggles with <a href=#>her work-life balance</a>.</p><p>In order to juggle her gigs and motherhood, Eva will “pass on a project” if it doesn’t fit in her schedule. The brunette beauty said it’s not as easy to “give it [her] all” now that she has the responsibilities of being there for her adorable child.</p><p>“I have to be more in charge and more structured and on time,” the SAG Award winner explained to the outlet. “The stakes are higher now that I have a child. I need to make sure I’m doing my part to leave the world a better place —for him and for all the children of our future.”</p><p>When it comes to instilling lessons in little Santi, Eva has a lot of goals she wants to accomplish in addition to <a href=#>raising an overall “good man</a>,” she shared. “I feel there’s more pressure to raise a good man today in this world and to make sure he understands equality and feminism,” she explained. “But it’s not about telling him, it’s about showing him in his everyday life.”</p><p>Eva is showing her kiddo the ropes and teaching Santi how to be a kind person, but the one thing that came naturally was her son’s “funny” personality. “<a href=#>He has my humor. He’s silly and I’m silly</a>,” she exclusively gushed to Closer Weekly in August 2019. “He’s a little ham. He hams it up all the time.”</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see Eva’s cutest photos of Santi!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46erZplnKS7qLvRopisZZOqwaa%2F02anoaekpMBuw8itn2arn6N6o63BsmSsmZ6ptnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
