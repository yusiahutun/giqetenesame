Yes, we're talking about gua sha (aka the Botox of the East).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fans of the tool report real, noticeable results, like firmer,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>smoother skin</a>&nbsp;and less acne, blemishes, and eczema. It sounds too good to be true, right? Well, we consulted skincare and traditional Chinese medicine practicing experts Sandra Lanshin Chiu and Anna Lam to find the most effective methods to use your little tool in order to deliver the best results.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sandra Lanshin Chiu</a>, L.Ac., is an acupuncturist, Chinese herbalist, and the founder of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Lanshin</a>, a healing studio.</li><li>Anna Lam is the founder of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>GingerChi</a>, a natural boutique in New York that carries its own line of gua sha tools and jade rollers.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for everything you need to know about facial gua sha.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-gua-sha></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Gua Sha?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Facial gua sha is a relatively new 'cosmetic' treatment derived from traditional gua sha, which is practiced on the body and is an important technique in traditional Chinese medicine," said Chiu. "Facial gua sha uses a smooth tool, often jade or&nbsp;quartz, to slowly stroke the face and neck, improving circulation and releasing tension."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chiu added that the practice dates back a long time — some records suggest as far back as the Paleolithic era.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Historically, tools were made from various types of materials like stones, coins, horns. Gua sha was used to treat pain and illnesses as serious as cholera," said Chiu.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Today, gua sha — as Chiu explained — is still used by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to "treat pain and boost immune function."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-gua-sha-works></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Gua Sha Works</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The gua sha technique, which translates to 'scrape wind,' was primarily first used on the body to release toxins and relieve pain in tired, sore, or injured muscles," said Lam. "By 'scraping' with repeated strokes on the surface of the skin, the gua sha helps stimulate new blood flow and draw out stagnation in the problem areas to help generate metabolic cell repair and healing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fear not, because while the traditional practice for your body is much more aggressive, resulting in bruising, Chiu said facial gua sha is meant to be performed at a much slower speed with much less pressure. In fact, when it comes to your face, Chiu advised to take the "less is more approach."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-benefits-of-gua-sha></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Benefits of Gua Sha</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Consistent practice can lead to noticeable results over time. Among them? Clearer, brighter, and tighter skin with fewer wrinkles, fine lines, and blemishes, according to Lam. However, the benefits don't stop there.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Gua sha is a practice intended to invigorate the healthy circulation of muscles and tissues that feed the skin, so I look at it as a health practice that has 'cosmetic side effects' like glowing skin and softening lines," said Chiu. "Improved circulation creates visible changes: reduced puffiness, smoother complexion, softened lines, reduced sagging, sculpt and lift to facial features, adds volume to sunken features, and it can even help acne heal faster."</p><p>Do not use gua sha directly on inflamed or open and picked skin. Instead, cover the area with a pimple patch before using.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pros of using gua sha aren't just cosmetic.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Facial gua sha is wonderful for releasing knots in the face, neck, and shoulders," added Chiu. "Many of the benefits are immediate, so it's an ideal technique for relief from headaches, sinus congestion, or a tight/painful jaw."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-use-the-gua-sha-tool-on-your-face></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Use the Gua Sha Tool on Your Face</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're new to gua sha, the good news is that using the tool is relatively straightforward.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Hold the gua sha tool with the curved side to your face and glide it gently up and out, starting with the neck, jawline, chin, and around the mouth, between three and five times per area," instructed Lam. "Then sweep across cheeks and gently glide under the eyes, across your eyebrows, and from your forehead up to your hairline."</p><p>Chiu noted that slow strokes with medium pressure are the most effective way to see results. Too hard and fast can result in "sha" or red marks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for how often you do this treatment, Lam recommended at least a few times a week, while Chiu told us you can gua sha daily. Although you can practice gua sha at any point during the day, incorporating it into your&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nightly facial routine</a>&nbsp;is a great way to stick to the practice, noted Chiu.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Gua sha is best done after both cleansing the face and applying a moisturizer or facial oil," added Lam. "Gua massage not only gives your skin a 'workout' but also helps products' nutrients absorb better into skin."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-choose-a-gua-sha-tool></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Choose a Gua Sha Tool</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lam suggested picking the tool you feel most drawn to, as there's no one model that works best, telling us, "They should all be carved with curves, rounded knobs, and points to fit within the curvatures of the face and press down on the meridian points," before adding, "or pressure points in which traditional Chinese medicine practitioners believe vital life energy known as Qi flows through.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The same goes for the crystal you choose for your gua sha: Find your favorite and stick with it. There's&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rose quartz</a>, jade, amethyst, and tiger's eye, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Each stone is known to have different healing properties, but all should provide similar results as it's more about the gua sha technique than the crystal of choice," said Lam.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Lam added that jade is traditionally used because it's cool to the touch and has detoxifying properties.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gua-sha-vs-jade-roller></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gua Sha vs. Jade Roller</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gua sha tools and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>jade rollers</a>&nbsp;often get grouped into the same holistic facial massage bucket; however, they bare some key differences. A jade roller is a simple tool — with one shape and one motion — often used to achieve more effective product penetration, lymphatic circulation, and overall relaxation. On the other hand, a gua sha tool has a unique shape with different edges that can contour your face, improve circulation, penetrate products, and relax tense muscles. Its benefits come from the motion rather than the material.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Chiu, the strokes applied during the gua sha process create stretching of the skin, which leads to myofascial release (face muscle relaxation and improvement of circulation). The scraper — as Lam noted — is used in stroking motion "over the facial curvatures in an attempt to bring new blood to the surface and promote lymphatic drainage."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Gua sha relaxes tension in facial muscles, which can cause lines. It's kind of like exercise for your face — with regular use, gua sha can tone skin and promote increased skin elasticity," Lam added.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bottom-line-on-gua-sha></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bottom Line on Gua Sha</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After consistent practice, facial gua sha can wield benefits like tighter, brighter, tauter, and smoother skin. Plus, according to traditional Chinese medicine, gua sha improves circulation and creates healthy energy. Embracing the practice may leave you feeling good — both inside and out.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-a6b1b5a6-a067-44c9-8b8f-069b5c8a8e0c></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=46.455314009662><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-0.88772845953003><p><span class=accordion__title>Can gua sha replace injectables?</span></p><p>While gua sha won't deliver the same immediate and drastic results as injectables, such as Botox and other fillers, practicing gua sha correctly will create a plumpness in your skin, with Chiu adding,&nbsp;"I think for those who feel hesitant about fillers, it's worth trying facial gua sha first."</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can I do gua sha on dry skin?</span></p><p>Using gua sha on too dry of skin can lead to irritation, suggested Chiu.
