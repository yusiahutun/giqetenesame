She runs the practice with her husband, Jordan R. Wagner, Esq. Kibbey’s focus is on criminal defense cases while Wagner’s focus is personal injury.</p><p class=p1>Kibbey started out right here on the Treasure Coast, where she graduated from Martin County High School. She went on to earn her bachelor’s degree from the University of Florida and her law degree from the University of Miami.</p><p class=p1>Kibbey began her legal career as a public defender locally in the 19th Judicial Circuit, where she was exposed to a wide variety of criminal cases, including first-degree felonies, juvenile offenses, and misdemeanor charges.</p><p class=p1>She left the public defender’s office to start her own firm, The Law Office of Barbara Kibbey, and shortly thereafter began the firm Kibbey | Wagner with her husband. Kibbey has been named one of the Top 100 Trial Lawyers by the National Trial Lawyers Association. She has also been named one of the Top 40 Lawyers Under the Age of 40 by <i>Superlawyers Magazine </i>in the State of Florida four years in a row.</p><p class=p1>Last year, she fulfilled a dream when she served as president of the Martin County Bar Association. It was a tremendous honor for Kibbey to be nominated by her peers to serve in such a prestigious position.</p><p class=p1>Most important, Kibbey is a devoted and caring mother to her two children. They are her pride and joy. She loves spending every free moment she can with them, going to the beach, horseback riding, and attending their baseball games and ballet recitals. Barbara feels incredibly blessed to be able to work and raise her family in the town where she grew up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZLmiw9ieqaxno6nCor7TaKeeqqOku6K4jKKlo62irnqttdOinpqsmaS7cK7Aq5maqpFiuKquwZ6waA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
