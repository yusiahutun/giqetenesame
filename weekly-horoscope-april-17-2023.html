To say this is screaming “chaos” is an understatement, because not only is Aries one of the most feisty and combative signs in the zodiac, but 29 degrees is what is known as the “anaretic degree”. In <a href=# id=auto-tag_astrology data-tag=astrology>astrology</a>, the anaretic degree is often associated with fated events and it is foreboding in the sense that something largely unpredictable could happen. And because an eclipse is already a time of <a href=#>sudden transformations and changes</a>, time will only tell how major this eclipse truly is.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newmoonintauruszodiac.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"><p>Eclipse season isn’t the only thing on your radar this week, because <a href=#>Mercury will also station retrograde at 15 degrees Taurus</a> on April 21, launching a three-week-long communication overhaul.

Today, you can feel in touch with the greater Universe. Aries, this could be a gentle caress and a nudge from the higher powers to get you to move toward your potential. Or this could be a shove into the limelight. Today, someone might put you on the spot and ask you about your goals.</p><p>On Tuesday, April 18, Venus in Gemini and your house of communication makes a semisquare to Jupiter in your own sign of Aries. A task you thought was all settled and done now seems to come unraveled. Aries, you can salvage this, but it must be done quickly. This offer could be going, going, gone in no time. But if you want this, you have just enough time to make it happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>This week, you’re in harmony with the changing energy.</p><p>The week begins on Sunday, April 16, with the sun in Aries and your house of rest and recuperation making a semisextile to Neptune in Pisces. This is a good day to take it slowly. Move through the day intentionally, paying attention to simple things like pouring tea or reading a book in a quiet corner.

It’s a good idea to go for clarity rather than try to be succinct.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cancer.png><p>This week, you’re planting fresh seeds.</p><p>The week begins on Sunday, April 16, with the sun in Aries and your house of reputation and life in the public eye making a semisextile to Neptune in Pisces. Today, the things you’ve been posting on social media are being seen by more people. Something you wrote could go viral. Or your pictures get more likes and notices from friends and family.

And this is what keeps you on social media.</p><p>On Tuesday, April 18, Venus in Gemini and your house of spiritual connections makes a semisquare to Jupiter in Aries. Today, you are looking to connect with something outside of yourself. You might be hiking in a forest and hear the wind whispering through the trees. Cancer, you could find a butterfly sitting on a flower beside you, reminding you of the glory of nature and the world. Today, you are communing with nature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Leo.png><p>This week, you’re opening your mind to possibilities.</p><p>The week begins on Sunday, April 16, with the sun in Aries and your house of travel making a semisextile to Neptune in Pisces.

Virgo, a resource you thought you had access to could evaporate. A person who promised to help you isn’t available when you need them. But everything will be all right if you can adjust your plans. You might need to change your schedule to accommodate this individual, or you might need to seek help from another source.</p><p>On Tuesday, April 18, Venus in Gemini and your house of career makes a semisquare to Jupiter in Aries. You might be offered a new project or even a new position at your company. This brings some great possibilities, but it could be outside your comfort zone. You’ll need to lean in to get the job done. Virgo, you are completely capable of doing it, of course, but you need to ask yourself if this is where you want to put your time and energy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Libra.png><p>This week, you could dazzle those around you.</p><p>The week begins on Sunday, April 16, with the sun in Aries and your house of relationships making a semisextile to Neptune in Pisces.

Libra, you could book a trip today, or perhaps you’re already on the road.
