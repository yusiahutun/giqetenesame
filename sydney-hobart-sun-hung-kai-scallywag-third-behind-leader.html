Stefan Racing was in fourth place.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">LawConnect appeared fourth on the official race tracker for a while because they were unable to report their position owing to electronic issues. When they reappeared, the NSW Racing representative was in the lead. As of early Tuesday morning, Black Jack had retaken the lead.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Scallywags have made it across Bass Strait over night! SHK Scallywag 100 is now sailing down the east coast of Tasmania in 3rd position, trailing leader Black Jack & LawConnect,” the Scallywag team posted on social media. “Ongoing race tracker issues aside it’s shaping up to be a close one – go Scallywags!.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Hong Kong boat sped off into the lead at the start on Sunday but suffered a technical issue at Sydney Heads and lost time as they fixed the problem.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As of Tuesday morning, Black Jack was leading a fleet that was down to 52 boats, including 10 two-handed entries after one of them, Rogue Wave, withdrew after sustaining damage. Black Jack was six nautical miles ahead of LawConnect, while Scallywag was in third place, another nine nautical miles astern.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/27/71bc119f-3792-4032-82b7-34f97c8f8273_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cruising Yacht Club of Australia Commodore Noel Cornish said the two leading supermaxis would be in a tussle for line honours, with a result not guaranteed until the finish line. He said the earlier rough conditions had abated, which would make for an exciting finish.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s now a tactical race,” Cornish said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqKyYmr9uv8%2Boqa1nkafBqq%2FLnmZsaWZmfnqCjqywnaaVrnqpu8Gaqa1lo6q7brTUp55mo5GeerSvwKWjsq%2BRnHq1tMirm2aalZ22r7CMpZyanJWn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
