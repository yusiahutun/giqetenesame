The 82-year-old former actress, television host, and Goodwill Ambassador for the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization</a> doesn’t seem to be slowing down, and she’s thrilled to receive her Kennedy Center Honors in 2023.</p><p>“I was very excited to hear because this is one of the most prestigious honors that can be given,” Warwick says. “Music is a steadfast bastion that we should all not only continue to recognize but know it as something that is absolutely necessary for the world to survive.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Debbie Allen</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Herbie Hancock</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ego Nwodim</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clive Davis</a> will take the stage to honor Warwick. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gladys Knight</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mickey Guyton</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Spinners</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cynthia Erivo</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chloe Bailey</a> will perform Warwick’s beloved hits “Say a Little Prayer,” “Then Came You,” “Alfie,” and “Walk on By,” respectively.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dionne Warwick Songs: 21 of Her Greatest Hits Guaranteed To Lift Your Spirits</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Billy Crystal talks Kennedy Center Honors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/2-32.jpg><p>While many award-winning actors get their start in daytime soap operas, Tony-winner, three-time Grammy winner, and six-time Emmy-winner Billy Crystal made his name by poking fun at the genre via the campy ‘70s TV satire, Soap. After his memorable run as a Saturday Night Live host and cast member in the mid-80s and his first comedy album, Marvelous!, Crystal went on to appear in instant classics like The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally and City Slickers.</p><p>Beyond his success on big screen and small, the standup comedian has hosted The Academy Awards nine times – earning five of his Emmys for performing his Oscar duties. He also joined <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robin Williams</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoopi Goldberg</a> in raising awareness and funds to fight poverty with Comic Relief, which aired from 1986- 2010.</p><p>“For me personally, there were so many surprises,” Crystal says of the Kennedy Center Honors celebration. “I’m just thrilled about being recognized for my body of work. It’s the highest honor that you can get for the arts. I’m very humble and grateful about my work and value it – especially as you get older! You look back, and you go, ‘Whoa, I did a lot of stuff!”</p><p>Crystal receives his Kennedy Center Honors from pals <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Reiner</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meg Ryan</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay Leno</a>, Goldberg, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert De Niro</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bob Costas</a>.

Not only was the star of CBS’s Equalizer honored to join her fellow Kennedy Center classmates, but she was also thrilled the night included a celebration of the 50th&nbsp;anniversary of hip hop.</p><p>“This is important for our entire country,” Queen Latifah says. “It’s important that hip hop is recognized as a true American art form that should be celebrated and honored in this way.</p><p>“I’m hoping I’m only the first of many women hip hop artists that get this award, and that hip hop continues to grow from here and really be treasured as what it is,” Latifah continues. “This changed our whole lives and created a whole economic stream for people who might not otherwise have had it, and opportunity. Hopefully, we’ll continue to do that.”</p><p>Former honoree <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rita Moreno</a> joins Van Van and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Missy Elliott</a> in presenting Latifa with her Kennedy Center Honor, while Kerry Washington shares the Queen’s story.</p><p>With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MC Lyte</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Monie Love</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">D-Nice</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yo-Yo</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RM Band</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Van Van</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rapsody</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Clark Sisters</a>&nbsp;set to take the stage, Latifah fans can expect to see renditions of “Latifah’s Had It Up to Here,” “Ladies First,” “U.N.I.T.Y ” “Just Another Day,” “You Brought the Sunshine,” “Winki’s Theme,” and “I Know Where I’ve Been.”</p><p>“My heroes of hip hop on the stage honoring me is, like, unbelievable,” Queen Latifah admits.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Renée Fleming talks Kennedy Center Honors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/4-28.jpg><p>Five-time Grammy-winning soprano Renee Fleming is the most classical of the 2023 Kennedy Center Honorees, with a repertoire that covers opera, classical, jazz, and pop. Beyond sharing her incomparable voice with the world, the advocate edited the book <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Music and Mind: Harnessing The Arts For Health And Wellness</a>, which features essays from creative and scientific thought leaders.</p><p>The icon – who has been called on to perform for occasions like the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony and the Super Bowl – admits that when she performed for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Van Cliburn</a> at the 2001 Kennedy Center Honors, she couldn’t help but dream about receiving the honor herself.</p><p>“I just thought, ‘Wow, someday… wouldn’t that be amazing if I got one of these?’” Fleming recalls. “But all of us, the other honorees and I, have said, still, when it happens, it’s incredible. It’s overwhelming. It’s unbelievable. This is especially meaningful to me. It’s a big deal, and I’m incredibly honored and so grateful.”</p><p>De Niro, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sigourney Weaver</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tituss Burgess</a> join <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine Baranski</a> in honoring Fleming, while Disney alum turned pop diva <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dove Cameron</a>&nbsp;introduces a new generation to Fleming’s sound by performing “The Light in the Piazza” with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Vaccariello</a>.</p><p>Additional tributes to Fleming include <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julia Bullock</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ailyn Pérez</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Angel Blue</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadine Sierra&nbsp;</a>collaborating on “Song to the Moon” with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Summers </a>and Tituss Burgess, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Susan Graham</a>, Christine Baranski, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rev.

With a 60-year career behind him, however, the British Grammy-winner’s Kennedy Center Honor also reflects his reign as one of the most prolific hit songwriters of our time.</p><p>“I love writing and working with other people, especially ladies,” Gibb says. “So it’s always worked well for me to work with Dionne, <a href=#>Barbra Streisand</a>, and people like that.”</p><p>While receiving the Kennedy Center Honors was surreal and fabulous, the former Bee Gee missed sharing the stage with late brothers, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robin</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maurice</a> – with whom he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.</p><p>“I’ve watched it for years, and I always thought, ‘Well, maybe one day,’” Gibb says of the Kennedy Center Honors. “I didn’t know it was going to be without my brothers. It’s just the way things happen in life. But they deserve this too.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Grant </a>and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Gibb</a> join The 46th Annual Kennedy Center Honors host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gloria Estefan</a> in presenting Gibb with his honor, while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariana DeBose</a>&nbsp;brings the house down with a disco medley featuring “How Deep Is Your Love,” “Night Fever,” “Stayin’ Alive,” and “You Should Be Dancin’” with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chloe Flower</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Platt</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Big Town,</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Bublé</a> also perform “Nights on Broadway” with Wayne Linsey, “Lonely Days,” and “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart,” respectively.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>1960s Love Songs: 20 Heartfelt Hits That Will Leave You Totally Smitten</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to watch The 46th Annual Kennedy Center Honors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/7-16.jpg><p>In her role as The Kennedy Center Honors host for the third consecutive year, Gloria Estefan&nbsp;will perform her hits “Conga” and “Get on Your Feet” with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Sheila&nbsp;E.</a> The star-studded celebration of this year’s Kennedy Center honorees Billy Crystal, Renée Fleming, Barry Gibb, Queen Latifah, and Dionne Warwick will include appearances and performances from the likes of Gladys Knight, Michael Bublé, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Herbie Hancock</a>, Cynthia Erivo, Robert De Niro, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kerry Washington</a>, MC Lyte, Christine Baranski, Little Big Town, and more.</p><p>The 46th&nbsp;Annual Kennedy Center Honors will air Wednesday, December 27&nbsp;at 8:00 PM ET/PT on CBS and stream on Paramount+ (live and on-demand for Paramount+ with SHOWTIME subscribers or on demand for Paramount+ Essential subscribers the day after the special airs).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF9pg7W0jJqlp62RoXqssc2nnJ2xXZiyr8DEq2Shp56kv7Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
