Just when it seems she's about to sink into oblivion, a stranger’s hand comes into the frame and latches onto her arm.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>“Ready?” the Ocean Eyes singer captioned the video.&nbsp;</p><p>A few hours before she posted the teaser, Eilish&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;on her Instagram stories, “I’M TELLING YOU SOMETHING TOMORROW.”&nbsp;</p><p>Leading up to her big announcement, the nine-time Grammy winner teased her upcoming era via mysterious billboards across New York and Los Angeles, advertising what we suppose would be&nbsp;her new lyrics. One of them read, “She's the headlights; I'm the deer.” Another one read, “I try to live in black and white,” while a third billboard added, “Did I cross the line?”&nbsp;</p><p>Eilish&nbsp;also recently added all of her Instagram followers to her close friend's list, a move that earned her 7 million new followers in just two days, per Billboard. On her Instagram, Billie has been posting blue-hued artwork and messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=6615057e9e836><strong>Beef with Rolling Stone: They brought it on themselves</strong></h2><p><img alt="Billie Eilish (Instagram)" title="Billie Eilish (Instagram)" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1712649465_image-1280x720-2024-04-09t132711-compressed.jpg></p><p>Following Eilish’s album announcement on Monday, Rolling Stone, the pop culture magazine, without any regard for the star singer’s wishes to keep things under wraps until May 17, released the album’s tracklist in an online article.&nbsp;</p><p>Eilish, clearly annoyed by the said article, took to her Instagram to blast the publication.&nbsp;</p><p>“F**k you guys @Rolling Stone,” she wrote in a since-deleted Instagram story.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Rolling Stone has since updated their article, screenshots of the original story containing Eilish's&nbsp;track list&nbsp;have already made&nbsp;the rounds on Reddit, per News.com.au.&nbsp;</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Billie Eilish Announces Release Of New Album Hit Me Hard And Soft; Deets Inside",1293786,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/beyonce-scripts-history-as-first-black-woman-with-cowboy-carter-reaching-no-1-on-billboard-top-country-albums-chart-1293769","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/billie-eilish-announces-release-of-new-album-hit-me-hard-and-soft-deets-inside-1293786","Content Also read","entertainment","hollywood"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Billie Eilish Announces Release Of New Album Hit Me Hard And Soft; Deets Inside",1293786,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/beyonce-scripts-history-as-first-black-woman-with-cowboy-carter-reaching-no-1-on-billboard-top-country-albums-chart-1293769","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/billie-eilish-announces-release-of-new-album-hit-me-hard-and-soft-deets-inside-1293786","Beyonce Scripts History As First Black Woman With Cowboy Carter Reaching No 1 On Billboard Top Country Albums Chart","Also_Read","entertainment","hollywood")'><strong>Beyonce Scripts History As First Black Woman With Cowboy Carter Reaching No 1 On Billboard Top Country Albums Chart</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528rbjYsKaonF%2BXtq24yJ5knqGcnsCpecCnpaitnpiytHnRnqOemaOaerCyjKecsGWRoa%2B2uYyhoK1lnZp6qa3RnWSappRiwLCy02abnp2kqHqqutKim55lYWeGdIOXbw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
