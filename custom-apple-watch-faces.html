You can bring that elegance to an Apple Watch with the aptly named California face.</p><p>It lets you customize the numbers on the dial for the regular California style or other options, such as all Roman. There are a number of different colors to select from as well.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The full-screen face option on the Series 4 and later features two complication spots. There are four complications spots in the smaller circular face.</p><h3 id=timelapse>2.

The inner face shows the local time, while the outer dial is a 24-hour dial to track a second time zone.</p><p>To make the most of the face, tap its center to select a curated city from the list. You can also add a specific city from the World Clock list. The two-toned color scheme shows day and night, along with sunrise and sunset, in the selected city. There are a huge number of color choices to select from, with many matching the hues of Apple Watch bands.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>There are four complication spots on the outside corners to further customize the face.</p><h3 id=astronomy>4.
