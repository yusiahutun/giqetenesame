They will partially close their shops again on New Year’s Eve for the same reason.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The decision came after the vendors accepted the recommendation of the Jung District Office, where the shopping mecca is located.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was not an easy decision and there were some disagreements,” Lee said, “But we came to an agreement that people’s safety should come first and that this is the right decision for Myeongdong’s future in the long run,” Lee Kang-soo, the union’s manager, told The Korea Times during a phone interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/19/fc396027-280d-444a-977e-835391ff96f0_042e348a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee explained that this is the first time in his 20 years of working as a street vendor that all the street vendors in Myeongdong will simultaneously close on the busiest and most anticipated holiday of the season.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Myeongdong is one of the most popular destinations for tourists in Seoul, known for its pedestrian-friendly shopping district and diverse street food stalls.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over 360 street vendors authorised to run businesses in Myeongdong operate every other day from 3pm to 11pm, with each stall operating 15 days a month, yielding a total daily average of 130 stalls in operation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They offer a wide range of traditional, seasonal and trendy street delicacies, ranging from tteokbboki (spicy rice cakes) to tornado-shaped fried potatoes, as well as souvenirs such as hats and clothes with Korean-style embroidery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since December 2019, the tourist-dependent area has been hit hard by the pandemic and still sees a 52.5 per cent vacancy rate, according to the latest report by real estate consulting group Cushman and Wakefield Korea released in September.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Police deployed to tackle Seoul subway crowds to avert Itaewon-like crush</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It saw sales loss of more than 60 per cent in 2020 as the number of visitors also dramatically decreased – the number of passengers at Myeongdong station on Seoul Metro Line No. 4 halved from 1.24 million to 610,084 over three years – from June 2019 to June 2022.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee said that he and his peers, who had no choice but to close down their street vendor businesses and make a living from delivery and part-time jobs for three years during the pandemic, have been waiting for this year’s Christmas and new year holidays ― as they have been expecting double the size of a typical weekend crowd to gather to enjoy the year-end festivities, Lee explained.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Lee said that, after less than a month of being back in business following the ebbing of the pandemic and easing of social-distancing measures, he decided not only to close down his stall but also to volunteer to prevent another crowd crush disaster like the one that claimed 159 lives in Itaewon on October 29.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A group of 25 street vendors will join the Jung District Office on Christmas Eve to control passenger traffic and prevent congestion, because, “we [street vendors] know where, when and how crowds form here, from decades of experience of running businesses”, Lee said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are looking forward to the return of foreign travellers in February and March,” Lee said. “We wish everybody a safe and happy holidays and hope they will come back to Myeongdong next year.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miYrKGRZLKiv9NmmKyhkWSus8DInKOeZ2NnfXSDk21mrKelqbVut86rnJqrXaLGprvNoJuoppdiwLW%2BxJ6rZq6Vo7GwvtJmmqWno5p6pLTRoqqtpZGoeqbCxGanq52mmru1ecCnpq2glad6tLHOrqNmoJGhubDDxJ6lZpuiqsCp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
