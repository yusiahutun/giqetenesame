So much had already happened in the series since its premiere on 1 May 2022 when word got away in Atlanta that Sheree Whitfield and Tyrone Gilliams have called it quits after RHOA.</p><p>Sheree and Tyrone Gilliams’s relationship after seeing its start in 2010 had rebloomed in 2021. As of June 2022 and they were still airing on the show when the rumors of their break-up spurred in real-time.</p><p>So, we thought this would be the right time to take you through a tell-all about Tyrone, as Shereé Whitfield’s boyfriend, and other areas of his life.</p><h3><strong>Meet Tyrone Gilliams, Shereé Whitfield’s Boyfriend</strong></h3><p>Fans remember Shereé Whitfield calling Tyrone Gilliams her soulmate. They were also around to witness when the couple met on the party scene as Tyrone marketed himself as a party promoter and hired Shereé for club appearances. Apparently, it was because of Tyrone that Shereé had a falling out with Nene Leakes. Albeit, it is unclear when the two began dating.</p><p>Later, when Tyrone was being convicted, he had stopped contacting Shereé not wanting her tied up in his case. But even they ended up reconnecting and maintaining a relationship despite one being in prison. After eight years of serving the sentence for a securities and wire fraud scheme, he was freed from Philadelphia halfway house in 2021. Shereé, meanwhile, had traveled two hours to meet him in all those years.</p><p>But once he was back, the 5 June 2022-episode of RHOA, gave its viewers heartbreaking aftermath. Tyrone not only stood her up but also refused to take any of her calls. But, despite all the hurt caused, Shereé still did not seem necessarily ready to call it quits. “I don’t know if this is something that I’m ready to give up on”, she could be seen telling her daughter Tierra.</p><p>Before this seeming separation, the on-again and off-again couple had split one more time Tyrone lost his appeal. But, they had rekindled their relationship when he was eventually released.</p><p>And it is said, they were longer on speaking terms in November 2021 after Shereé bought Bravo cameras to film a scene with him at a restaurant.</p><h3><strong>Did Tyrone Gilliams And Shereé Whitfield Marry?</strong></h3><p>After Tyrone Gilliams was freed from prison in 2021, Shereé Whitfield was surrounded by marriage rumors.

Because the two, despite the long romance have never been married to each other.</p><p>Shereé had said on RHOA that she dated Tyrone for eight months before he was sentenced to prison in 2013. And a year before that, when the world knew Tyrone as an “Ivy League scam artist”, he lived in an attractive Art Museum-area house with his two young kids and their mother.</p><p>Shereé also has been married before and she has talked about her child support struggle with her ex-husband Bob Whitfield during her early seasons on RHOA.</p><h3><strong>Tyrone Gilliams Age</strong></h3><p>Tyrone Gilliams was reportedly born in 1967.
