bombshell Maryse Mizanin also began her career as a beauty pageant contest, winning the coveted title of Miss Hawaiian Tropic Canada in 2003.</p><p>She joined WWE three years later and appeared in Playboy no fewer than 12 times according to IMBd, with Playboy Vixens shoot selling out in less than 24 hours on the east coast.</p><p>Maryse was also on the cover of Playboy's 2007 Girls of Canada calendar, and she even has her own reality TV show entitled Miz and Mrs, based on her relationship with husband Mike.</p><h3>Torrie Wilson</h3><img

fellow wrestler Nidia Guenard.</p><p>She then appeared on the cover alongside another WWE stunner, Sable (more on her later), sparking a row with Raw Divas Stacy Keibler and Miss Jackie.</p><p>After weeks of bitter rivalry, Wilson and Sable defeated Keibler and Miss Jackie in a quite wonderfully titled Playboy Evening Gown match at WrestleMania XX by stripping their opponents of their evening

Maria Kanellis, a star of beauty pageants in her youth, was also drafted via the Diva route and has enjoyed a long career in the sport ever since.</p><p>Kanellis was reportedly first asked to pose for Playboy when she was just 19, but turned down the offer for fear of embarrassing her sister.</p><p>Those fears subsided some years later, however, when she posed for the cover of the April 2008 issue, with an accompanying nude pictorial. Later that year, FHM named her 53rd on their "The Sexiest Women 2008" list.</p><h3>Candice Michelle</h3><h3></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25504512.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-90313263.jpg><h3><br></h3><p>Having started her career as a model and an actor, Candice Michelle was hired by WWE in 2004.</p><p>It didn't take long for her to follow the traditional Diva route of posing for Playboy, showing herself off on the cover and starring in a nude pictorial in April 2006.</p><p>The first former Diva Search contestant to win a WWE title, she was released from her contract in 2009 but returned in 2019 to win the WWE 24/7 championship.</p><p>During her time in WWE, she also appeared in several intriguingly named contests, including the first ever Bra and Panties Gauntlet Match and the Playboy Pillow Fight at Wrestlemania 22.</p><h3>Chyna</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25504532.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Animal-Fair-Magazines-9th-Annual-Paws-for-Style.jpg><p>Billed as the Ninth Wonder of the World during her time with WWF (later WWE), Chyna, real name Joan Laurer, was a a firm favourite among wrestling and Playboy fans alike.</p><p>She appeared in the magazine twice, with her first shoot one of the best selling issues of all-time. An unlikely sex symbol, she released a sex tape with fellow wrestler Sean Walman, entitled 1 Night in China, in 2004.</p><p>Chyna appeared in further videos, including Backdoor to Chyna, which somehow missed out on an Oscar nomination, and was widely referred to as the First Lady of Sports Entertainment.</p><h3>Sable</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25505537.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS251136551.jpg><p>Don't mess with Sable, because you'll have iconic former WWE, UFC and NCAA heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar to answer to.</p><p>The couple, who met while working for WWE, have been married since 2005.</p><p>Sable first broke onto the wrestling scene in the later 1990s and was arguably as crucial to the Attitude era as household names like Steve Austin and The Rock.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25504559.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-104990508.jpg><p>She holds the distinction of being the first WWE babe to strip nude for Playboy, while her appearance on the front cover of the April 1999 issue made it one of the highest selling editions ever.</p><p>A stone cold sex symbol, she appeared on the front cover of the mag three times.</p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25328683><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Sexiest Halloween outfits worn by WAGs - including Arsenal star's spooky bride" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25328683><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25504564.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-787444.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25328722.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_BANNER-Sexiest-Halloween-outfits-worn-by-WAGs-including-Arsenal-stars-spooky-nurse-lover.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=25328683>Sexiest Halloween outfits worn by WAGs - including Arsenal star's spooky bride</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24405551><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|Image aria-label="Wales' hottest fan and OnlyFans star offers cheeky treat to supporters after Euro horror" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24405551><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25504568.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-178194715.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24405528.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_hwwmain.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index4|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24405551>Wales' hottest fan and OnlyFans star offers cheeky treat to supporters after Euro horror</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e9awnGafmae5tHnNmqKenF2luaLFwaiwZqWRnK67tc2eZGttZWWAeoSR</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
