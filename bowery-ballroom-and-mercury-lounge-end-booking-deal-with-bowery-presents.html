I would personally like to thank Michelle for all she has done for and meant to the Mercury Lounge. She held it as her own and gave everything of herself; it’s continued success speaks volumes. I wish her only the best wherever she finds herself on the pathway to talent buying greatness.</p><p>"In her stead, I’m pleased to announce (and please welcome) Ariel Bitran. Ariel has been in the throes of the NYC music scene as a musician and promoter/talent buyer for the past 12 years. Most recently he has booked Sunnyvale, growing it into one of Brooklyn’s most formidable venues for Indie, Electronic and Alternative music. Prior to that Ariel developed and booked the internationally renowned DIY Brooklyn venue Palisades. During his NYC tenure, he has developed a long list of relationships with acts and agents alike; those who have yet to get to know him will find his passion for music is contagious.</p><p>"Sydney Sanial will continue serve in the role of assistant talent buyer, working directly and solely with Ariel and the Mercury Lounge."</p><p>The change in booking was not entirely unexpected. When AEG Presents acquired Bowery Presents earlier this year, the deal did not include either the Bowery Ballroom and the Mercury Lounge after their contract expired.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGian6yys8WMm5ilpKKkvK55wKebZqWVp7C2vthmo6itnpyybrHNnWSbp5%2Bgtq%2BzjJ2cmqRdrLa1tIybprCdoq56sb7ErJynrKNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
