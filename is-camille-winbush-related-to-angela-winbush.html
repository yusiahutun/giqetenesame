Instead, she wished to be an architect and would study architecture at Howard University.</p><p>Those university fees weren’t cheap, however, and so to earn some extra money, Angela would sing in the evening, and while in church. She joined a group called ‘Hot Tea’ where she provided lead vocals.</p><p>Now she began getting the music bug and her band actually opened for a number of well-known musicians.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-30746 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Angela-Winbush-Net-Worth.jpg.webp alt="Angela Winbush Net Worth" width=1222 height=813 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Angela-Winbush-Net-Worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-30746 class=wp-caption-text>© Guliver / Getty Images</p><p>She changed her major to music education at college in 1977 and recorded her own demo, which she sent out to all who would listen.</p><p>She had no success with the demo, until New York DJ Gary Byrd heard it, and made a call that landed Angela a spot on Stevie Wonder’s backing vocal group ‘Wonderlove.’ She became his protégé.</p><p>While she was in LA with Stevie, she met a singer named Rene Moore. The two hit it off and would form the duo Rene & Angela later that year.</p><p>They had numerous hits, including 2 top 20 R&B hits, one of which was the hugely popular ‘My First Love, which won her an award in 2002.</p><h2><strong>Who is Camille Winbush?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-57865 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Camille-Winbush.jpg.webp alt="Camille Winbush" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Camille-Winbush.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-4 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-57865 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>From one Winbush to the next, we now have Camille Winbush.</p><p>Camille was born on February 9th, 1990, and is an actress, singer, songwriter, and musician.</p><p>She is best known for playing Vanessa ‘Neesa’ Thomkins on the Bernie Mac Show, as well as Emma Almes on the sitcom ‘Minor Adjustments.’</p><p>She also tried her hand at drama, where she played Lauren Treacy on ‘The Secret Life of the American Teenager.’</p><p>Camille was born in Los Angeles, California, and was the only child of Alice and Anthony Winbush.</p><p>Why is this important?</p><p>Because there are some rumors that Camille Winbush is actually the younger sister of Angela Winbush.</p><p>She began acting at a young age, and in 1996 she appeared alongside <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> in Eraser, where she played a young girl aptly named ‘Camille.’</p><p>She received her big break in 2001, when she was cast as Vanessa on The Bernie Mac Show. She was a popular character with fans and would play the role until the series came to an end in 2006.</p><p>The role of Neesa would land Camilla a number of award nominations and awards, including a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series.</p><p>Since then, she has gone on to act in other shows and land other parts, though none have proved to be quite as popular as The Bernie Mac Show.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Are Mikey Williams and Jada Williams related</a>?</p><h2><strong>So, is Camille Winbush related to Angela Winbush?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-57868 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Are-Camille-Winbush-and-Angela-Winbush-related.jpg.webp alt="Are Camille Winbush and Angela Winbush related" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Are-Camille-Winbush-and-Angela-Winbush-related.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-5 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-57868 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Because of how the internet works, rumors are easily started, easily spread, and sadly, easily believed.</p><p>Because the two share the same last name, people often ask if Camille Winbush is related to Angela Winbush.</p><p>It is reasonable to ask the question, but the problem is that people are too quick to believe these rumors, without any evidence.</p><p>One popular rumor, for example, is that Angela Winbush is Camille’s older sister.</p><p>Considering the fact that Angela is more than 35 years older than Camille, you can see why this is such a preposterous rumor to believe.</p><p>Just to put it to bed once and for all, no, Camille and Angela Winbush are not sisters!</p><p>But are the two related in another way, perhaps? Well, again, no, they are not.</p><p>There is no evidence to suggest that the two are related, nor have the two ever claimed to be related.</p><p>Actually, the only real link is the fact that they share the same last name.</p><p>By that logic, every Winbush around the world should be related to the two.</p><p>So, no, as far as we are aware, Camille Winbush and Angela Winbush are not related.</p><p>The two are very talented and share the same last name, but that’s as far as the connection between the two goes.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Are Jack Harlow and Winnie Harlow related</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfnsBur8CmoKWklWLEqrrBrqqhZaKauaLAxJ1kraddlruoscuaZLChnpfCtLSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
