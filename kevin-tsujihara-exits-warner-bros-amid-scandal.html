Kevin acknowledges that his mistakes are inconsistent with the Company’s leadership expectations and could impact the Company’s ability to execute going forward.”</p><p>Tsujihara has been in embroiled over allegations of sexual misconduct and recently issued an apology to his colleagues that seems to confirm the allegations that have been leveled against him.</p><p>In an internal memo obtained by&nbsp;<a href=#>Deadline</a>, Tsujihara apologized for “mistakes in his personal life that have caused pain and embarrassment to the people I love the most.” He also apologized for embarrassing the company.</p><p>“I realized some time ago you are right to expect more from me and I set a course to do better. That journey continues,” he wrote.</p><p>He also reaffirmed WarnerMedia’s statement that it had retained an independent law firm to investigate the allegations against Tsujihara, which include using his influence to obtain roles in Warner Bros. projects for an actress he was alleged to have had a sexual relationship with.</p><p>The following was recently issued to staff by Tsujihara:</p><p>Dear Colleagues,</p><p>Over the past week and a half, I have been reflecting on how the attention on my past actions might impact the company’s future. After lengthy introspection, and discussions with John Stankey over the past week, we have decided that it is in Warner Bros.’ best interest that I step down as Chairman and CEO.</p><p>I love this company and the people that make it so great. I’ve been honored to head this organization and work alongside all of its talented employees over the past 25 years. Together we’ve built this studio into an unequivocal leader in the industry.</p><p>However, it has become clear that my continued leadership could be a distraction and an obstacle to the company’s continued success. The hard work of everyone within our organization is truly admirable, and I won’t let media attention on my past detract from all the great work the team is doing.</p><p>I am overwhelmed and grateful for the outpouring of support I have received from colleagues and industry partners during this difficult time.</p><p>Again, I am so proud of the great work that you do every day to make Warner Bros. the gold standard in our industry. It has been a pleasure to work alongside each and every one of you, and I wish you all the absolute best.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Kevin Tsujihara</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoZwfJJoaHFnm5rDqrqMraquopmdrrOtjJ6voqyjYsSivs2eqWaaoqTAbq3Moptmq5OWu6Wty2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
