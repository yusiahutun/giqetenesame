To keep those relationships strong, Vibrant has reimagined what a branch can be and is flipping the script in the communities we serve,” said Matt McCombs, President and CEO of Vibrant. “Most of the time, we’ll just be your favorite place to grab coffee and a quick meal, catch up on work, or hang out with friends. But when you need help with your financial goals, we’re here for you.”</p><p>In-house dining and drive-thru offerings include:<br>• A variety of beverages, including espressos, energy drinks, hot and iced teas, chai and smoothies;<br>• All-day breakfast options and lunch items including sandwiches, soups and salads;<br>• House-roasted, locally produced coffee beans to enjoy at home;<br>• One-of-a-kind apparel and gifts from local artisans and suppliers.</p><p>The Bettendorf Coffeehouse will be open to the public, like the Moline location. Vibrant members receive a 20% discount on all food and beverage orders when they pay with a Vibrant card.</p><p>Bettendorf’s Vibrant Coffeehouse and Kitchen is expected to open by the end of 2023. The hours of operation will be announced later this year. Members who usually banked at the Bettendorf branch can visit Vibrant’s Moline branch, located at 6600 44th Avenue, Suite 1 in Moline or can conduct most business, including face-to-face transactions with Vibrant bankers, from a smartphone or tablet. Credit union services at Vibrant Coffeehouse and Kitchen will be available when it reopens.</p><p>For more information about the project, click <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaK2imqKWu7V5wqucnaGkYsKvtc6nZKKmXZeytcDEp5uoqpZiv6a6zq%2BYraGenHq1u4ybnJynnZp6pLvFn5yeoJ%2BqwKZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
