As a self-taught dancer known for her infectious, powerful popping style, Lee took herself from doing playful routines in her living room to becoming a globally recognized elite dance champion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lee says she gets her makeup inspiration from Instagram, and over the years she's learned different tricks on how to make her beat stay put. "I've tried different makeup styles, but my makeup hasn't really changed, I like to create a classy look, I don't like to add a lot of color to my face," she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Lee's Go-To Beauty Products</span></h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-yves-saint-laurent-touche-eclat-le-teint-radiant-liquid-foundation></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Yves Saint Laurent Touche Eclat Le Teint Radiant Liquid Foundation</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>COURTESY</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This radiant <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>foundation</a> has an advanced formula that reduces the look of fatigue and creates flawless medium coverage. "I like using this foundation because it blends nicely and is not too thick or heavy," the dancer shares.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-laura-mercier-translucent-loose-setting-powder></span><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>COURTESY</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>award-winning powder</a> is not only a favorite of Lee's, but beauty influencers rave about it as well. The light formula boasts long-lasting wear without adding weight or texture. It absorbs oil and reduces shine all day, creating a flawless, matte finish with no flashback in photos. "When I'm dancing I sweat a lot; I apply this powder to set my makeup and help remove shine," says Lee. "I used to apply foundation on its own, but I've noticed that when I use powder, my makeup stays longer."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dior-diorshow-on-stage-liquid-eyeliner></span><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>COURTESY</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>waterproof liquid eyeliner</a> offers up to 24-hours of wear and has a hybrid tip that combines the ease of a felt-tip pen with the suppleness of a brush. "I always use a waterproof eyeliner," says Lee. "I like this pen-style tip — there's not too much ink on the brush so it's easy to draw a sharp line. I don't like to use the regular liquid as it gets too messy. I used to just wear eyeliner on its own but when I sweat it goes everywhere, so now, I apply black eyeshadow on top of the eyeliner and it stays much longer."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-maybelline-volum-express-the-colossal-mascara></span><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>COURTESY</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This clump-free mascara delivers nine times the volume in just one coat.

"I chose popping and hip-hop because of the music," says McNeal who is now a global champion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The dancer gets her makeup inspiration from the '90s, otherwise known as the genre's golden era. "I feel like the makeup in the '90s was a lot simpler, it was low maintenance," says McNeal. "I don't have a lot of time, the more time it takes me to do my makeup, the less time I have to train."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">McNeal describes her makeup look as natural and says she tries to keep it minimal. "I am constantly wiping my face whenever I sweat," she explains. "I often have to get touch-ups when I'm on set, but they're not the best for my skin, especially if I am sweating and then applying more makeup on top of the sweat. I don't want my skin to look bare, but I want it to be able to breathe."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>McNeal's Go-To Beauty Products</span></h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aztec-secret-indian-healing-clay-deep-pore-cleansing-face--body-mask></span><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>COURTESY</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This mask contains just one ingredient: 100 percent natural calcium bentonite clay, which is amazing for absorbing excess oil and drawing out impurities in the skin. "I use this mask to prep my skin, it helps to detox and close my pores," says the dancer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fenty-beauty-by-rihanna-flyliner-longwear-liquid-eyeliner></span><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>COURTESY</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Experience the crisp color intensity of a liquid plus the glide of a gel with this long wearing, water-resistant eyeliner "I like to use this eyeliner because it's waterproof, dries fast, and doesn't fade," says McNeal.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fenty-beauty-by-rihanna-mattemoiselle-plush-matte-lipstick-in-pms></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Mattemoiselle Plush Matte Lipstick in PMS</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>COURTESY</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This ultra-slim lipstick has a long-wearing, petal-soft matte finish, created in a rainbow of weightless, color-intense shades designed to flatter all skin tones. "This lipstick stays put. There are times when I am eating constantly because I have to refuel, and I don't have to worry about my lipstick coming off. I can go straight from a performance to a media interview and my lipstick will still be intact," says the dancer.
