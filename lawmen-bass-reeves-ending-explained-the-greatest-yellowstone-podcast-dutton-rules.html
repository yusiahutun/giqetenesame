Bass Reeves was a real-life 19th century U.S. Marshal, but he's not the only character you can research. The slave owner who Reeves follows into war is one of the many arresting characters that loved, lived and killed.</p><p>Yep, there is plenty of blood, murder and violence on this new Paramount+ show, too. It's all part of this week's episode of the <a href=#>Dutton Rules </a>podcast.</p><p>The first two episodes of Bass Reeves cover about 15 years, from the Civil War to Reeves' life as a farmer, before being deputized. A very unique assignment involving Dennis Quaid's character takes him onto an Indian reservation, where he's able to showcase his knowledge of native life, as well as his quick draw and open compassion.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>Lawmen: Bass Reeves Premiere Offers a Mix of Violence and Faith&nbsp;</a></p><p>Two things happen at the end of the show that viewer will want to keep an eye on: The first is that Reeves gets invited to become a U.S. Marshal. The second is that viewers discover George Reeves wasn't killed when Bass attacked him to get his freedom. In fact, history tells us the older Texan goes on to become a popular legislator.</p><p>Bonus fact: Bass' daughter is being courted by a young boy named Arthur Mayberry, who may look familiar. Actor Lonnie Chavis also played young Randall Pearson on NBC's This Is Us.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>attachment-Yellowstone Dutton Rules 2</span></p>Emerson Miller/Paramount+<p>loading...</p></figure><p>Two Yellowstone Season 2 episodes also aired on CBS on Sunday.
