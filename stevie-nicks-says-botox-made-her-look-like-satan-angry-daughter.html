"It started with the line, 'She was the prettiest girl in the world / But that was a long time ago.' And that's something that I have said to a lot of my younger friends -- no matter how beautiful you are, you're going to get older and you're not going to look like you did when you were 25. So roll with the punches."</p><p>The 72-year-old rock legend went on to admit that she plans to avoid more anti-aging pitfalls after injecting toxins into her forehead.</p><p>"Oh God, the Botox," she exclaimed. "Let me tell you, Botox only makes you look like you're in a satanic cult. I only had it once and it destroyed my face for four months. I would look in the mirror and try and lift my eyebrow and go, 'Oh, there you are, Satan's angry daughter.' Never again."</p><p>"I watch a lot of news and I see all the lady newscasters looking like Satan's angry daughters, too."</p><p>Despite denouncing the procedure, Nicks has been open about keeping her youthful glow in the past.</p><p>"I haven't laid out in the sun since I was 28," the icon told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People </a>when she turned 60. "While everyone else is out there burning up, I'm walking around going, 'When I do look 60, you will all look 100. Enjoy it now because you aren't going to be happy when I look young enough to get a date and you don't.' I'll still be going out when I'm 75. Everybody else will be in the rest home!"</p><p>Nicks recently made headlines after TikTok user Nathan Apodaca, who goes by @420doggface208, posted a video of himself skateboarding and lip-syncing to Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams," which Nicks wrote.</p><p>The clip went viral and the "Edge of Seventeen" hitmaker decided to join in on the fun by sharing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet </a>of her singing the song while putting on a pair of roller skates in her living room.</p><p>"Afternoon vibe. Lace 'em up!" she captioned the adorable post.</p><a id=gallery-link-5fcad834-f952-4245-8df1-4ca1e4c7c238 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:5fcad834-f952-4245-8df1-4ca1e4c7c238 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:fe01cdbe-2e67-4a3f-8f54-1d7fd7d2a5a5 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/11/4by3/2020/10/15/11cec03562ee4480809b6e2e127f9e27_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7kGlmam1fqMGmwsieZKehk6DAbr%2FAsqpmmp%2BpvLl5zJqbnmWYmr9uuM6oomakmaCybr%2FArZinZZGjtLPFjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
